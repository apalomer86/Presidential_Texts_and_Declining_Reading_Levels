"January 09, 2025",Eulogy at a Memorial Service for Former President Jimmy Carter,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-memorial-service-for-former-president-jimmy-carter,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Leaders of the clergy; distinguished guests; most importantly, the Carter family:
In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, Georgia. We wanted to see them.
Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. Together, we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage, an unassuming red-brick ranch home that reflects their modesty more than any trappings of power.
We walked in the living room, where Jimmy greeted us like family. That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost six decades. A deep friendship that started in 1974.
I was a 31-year-old Senator, and I was the first Senator outside of Georgia—I—maybe the first Senator—to endorse his candidacy for President. It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter's enduring attribute: character. Character. Character.
Because of that—character, I believe, is destiny—destiny in our lives and, quite frankly, destiny in the life of the Nation. It's an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life and a decent country: a life of purpose, a life of meaning.
Now, how do we find that good life? What does it look like? What does it take to build character? Do the ends justify the means?
Jimmy Carter's friendship taught me—and, through his life, taught me that strength of character is more than title or the power we hold. It's the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect; that everyone—and I mean everyone—deserves an even shot, not a guarantee, but just a shot.
You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor and to stand up to what my dad used to say is the greatest sin of all: the abuse of power.
And that's not about being perfect because none of us are perfect. We're all fallible. But it's about asking ourselves: Are we striving to do things—the right things? What values—what are the values that animate our spirit? Do we operate from fear or hope, ego or generosity? Do we show grace? Do we keep the faith when it's most tested?
For keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is a story, in my view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter's life. A story of a man—to state the obvious, you've heard today some great, great eulogies—who came from a house without running water or electricity and rose to the pinnacle of power. A story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his Savior and the ideals of this Nation. A story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to serve and shape the world.
The man had character. Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God and that his candidacy spoke and wrote about. Faith as a substance of things hoped for and evidence of the things not seen. Faith founded on commandments of Scripture: Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and love thy neighbor as thyself. Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do.
In his life—in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. It can be lonely. But it requires action to be the doers of the world.
But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the Gospel, found in many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. Because the very journey of our Nation is a walk of sheer faith to do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. A nation where all are created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
We've never fully lived up to that idea of America. But we've never walked away from it either, because of patriots like Jimmy Carter.
Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and a good and faithful servant of God and of the people.
And today, many think he was from a bygone era. But, in reality, he saw well into the future. A White Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. A hard-working farmer who championed conservation and clean energy. And a President who redefined the relationship with the Vice President.
Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. Together, they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust, as both were men of character.
And as we all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post-Presidency by making a powerful difference as a private citizen in America and, I might add, as you all know, around the world.
Through it all, he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flows to others. At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves: joy, solidarity, love, commitment—not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we've all been granted.
To make every minute of our time here on Earth count, that's the definition of a good life, a life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years. To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter's example.
I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again.
And to the entire Carter family, thank you—and I mean this sincerely—for sharing them both with America and the world. We love you all.
Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. We saw Jimmy as he always was: at peace, with a life fully lived. A good life of purpose and meaning, of character, driven by destiny and filled with the power of faith, hope, and love. I'll say it again: faith, hope and love.
As he returned to Plains, Georgia, for his final resting place, we can say goodbye. In the words of the prophet Micah, who Jimmy so admired until his final breath, Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly.
May God bless a great American and a dear friend and a good man. May he rise up—be raised up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn and make you to shine like the Sun and hold you in the palm of His hand.
God bless you, Jimmy Carter."
"January 07, 2025",Remarks by the Vice President at the Lying in State Ceremony for Former President Jimmy Carter,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-vice-president-the-lying-state-ceremony-for-former-president-jimmy-carter,Kamala Harris,eulogy,"THE VICE PRESIDENT: Leader Thune, Speaker Johnson, Leader Schumer, Leader Jeffries, members of Congress, and distinguished guests, it is an honor to be with you this afternoon.
And to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and Jason and all the other members of the Carter family, on behalf of the American people, Doug and I offer our deepest condolences.
Being with you today, I am reminded of the enduring words of a favorite hymn: May the works I have done speak for me.
Today, we gather to celebrate the life of a man whose works will echo for generations to come, a man from Plains, Georgia, who grew up without electricity or running water and served as the 39th president of the United States of America and lived every day of his long life in service to the people: President James Earl Carter, Jr.
So, I was in middle school when Jimmy Carter was elected president, and I vividly recall how my mother admired him, how much she admired his strength of character, his honesty, his integrity, his work ethic and determination, his intelligence, and his generosity of spirit.
We have heard much today and in recent days about President Carter's impact in the four decades after he left the White House. Rightly so. Jimmy Carter established a new model for what it means to be a former president and leaves an extraordinary post-presidential legacy, from founding the Carter Center, which has helped advance global human rights and alleviate human suffering, to his public health work in Latin America and Africa, to his tireless advocacy for peace and democracy around the globe.
And Jimmy Carter was a president of the United States who was ahead of his time. He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy. He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection and more than doubled the size of America's national parks, including protecting our beloved Redwoods in my home state of California.
He was a president who, between the years of 1977 and 1981, appointed more Black Americans to the federal bench than all of his predecessors combined and appointed five times as many women. And in the wake of Watergate, Jimmy Carter passed historic ethics legislation to help rebuild America's faith in government.
Jimmy Carter, as president, was also a respected global leader. To be sure, the years of his presidency were not without international crises or challenges, but his legacy of global leadership is well established.
In Asia, he instituted full diplomatic relations with China, which he would later call one of the most historically significant accomplishments of his presidency.
And his legacy lives on in the Middle East, because do recall in the decades before Jimmy Carter became president, Israel and Egypt had been at war numerous times. Few thought peace could be achieved between them. Yet Jimmy Carter did that. Through his persistence and perseverance, through his unshakable belief in the power of American diplomacy, he secured the Camp David Accords, one of the most significant and durable peace treaties since World War II.
And throughout the world, Jimmy Carter elevated the role of human rights in America's foreign policy priorities and uplifted the importance of civil society in doing that work.
Jimmy Carter was a forward-looking president with a vision for the future. Consider his establishment of the Department of Energy in 1977, which anticipated the central role it would play in addressing the climate crisis; his creation of FEMA in 1979, which enabled our nation to mobilize a national response to disasters which has helped countless communities rebuild and recover; and his founding of the Department of Education later that year, which elevated public education institutions and increased national standards for the education of America's children and future leaders.
Jimmy Carter was that all-too-rare example of a gifted man who also walks with humility, modesty, and grace. Recall the stories from the 1976 campaign about how he slept in the homes of his supporters to share a meal with them at their table and to listen to what was on their minds.
How, on their first trip for Habitat for Humanity, Jimmy and Rosalynn rode the bus with the other volunteers. And when the group stopped for the night to stay at a local church, Jimmy and Rosalynn gave their private room to a young couple who had put off their honeymoon to join the trip. And with the other volunteers, they then slept on the floor of the church basement.
And then, of course, his work to eradicate the vicious Guinea worm disease that once disabled millions of people a year. It was one of the Carter Center's greatest triumphs. And Jimmy Carter, of course, given his nature, attributed its success not to his own leadership but to the thousands of everyday Africans who were on the ground doing the work.
Throughout his life and career, Jimmy Carter retained a fundamental decency and humility. James Earl Carter, Jr., loved our country. He lived his faith, he served the people, and he left the world better than he found it.
And in the end, Jimmy Carter's work and those works speak for him louder than any tribute we can offer.
May his life be a lesson for the ages and a beacon for the future.
May God bless President Jimmy Carter. And may God bless the United States of America."
"October 16, 2024",Eulogy at a Memorial Service for Ethel Kennedy,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-memorial-service-for-ethel-kennedy,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Hello.
Joe, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm sure you're clapping because I'm the last speaker.
Well, that was worth that partial comment—or concert. You know what he said on the way out? Can I tell them, pal? He said, ""If I get a Grammy, I'm going to give it to you,"" the only guy in this whole darn church who can't sing a note. [ Laughter ]
My dad used to have a band and sang. He said: ""Joey, I don't know where the hell you came from. You can't carry a tune. You can't sing. You can't dance. I don't know where you came from, but I love you anyway."" [ Laughter ]
Father MacMillan, thank you for everything. Thank you for being so good to us.
President Clinton, President Obama, distinguished guests; the Kennedy family, children and grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and extended family: It's been an emotional journey listening to all of you. When I knew I was going to be the last speaker, I thought, ""How did that happen?"" Because, you know, it brings back so many memories.
Ethel was always there for so many people, and she played an essential role in my life as well—maybe a little different than with others. She was there as soon as I entered political office in 1972 as a 29-year-old kid before I got sworn in.
I was in her brother-in-law's office, Teddy's office, hiring staff—I was only 29; you had to be 30 years old to be sworn in, and I wasn't 30 yet—when I got a phone call from the fire department in my—by my house saying there had been an accident. A tractor-trailer had broadsided my wife's automobile, Christmas shopping with a Christmas tree on top, on December 18, and killed my wife and killed my daughter, and my boys weren't expected to live.
When I lost my family—and she was there. Joe, your mom was there then—then.
As soon as I got elected President, I received a letter from your mom. The letterhead was titled Mrs. Robert Kennedy, and in her very neat handwriting, she had written that she took great comfort in knowing the country was in good hands.
She had no idea, for a 29-year-old kid in that circumstance, how much it meant. Because, as some of you know—Bill knows—I didn't plan on sticking around after that accident.
She said she was honored and proud there was a bust of her husband, Bobby Kennedy, in my office, the Oval Office.
I have only two political heroes in my life: Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy. Not a joke. So I didn't realize—my two colleagues from the—who were President know—you get to pick what you want in your office, and I wanted to be able to see both of them from my—from the Resolute Desk by the fireplace: Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy.
And, days later, I received another letter from her that I'll always remember, and I know all of you look forward to each year: a valentine card—a valentine card. Which, in our house, Valentine's Day is known as ""Jill's holiday."" [ Laughter ]
Like Ethel, Jill is a practical joker. So it was no surprise—it was no surprise that Jill loved Ethel's card that year, which said—I'm not sure the hundred others who receive it felt the same way because, apparently, she sent that card—she sent it to everyone that year. [ Laughter ] It was a picture of me and Ethel surrounded by hearts. [ Laughter ] Oh, you think I'm kidding. I—it meant a lot to me, I'm telling you.
Printed—the language on the card, it said—in the printed language of the card, it said, ""I'm not Biden my time waiting for you, Valentine."" [ Laughter ] And then in her handwriting, she says, ""'Cause he's no ordinary Joe."" [ Laughter ]
I don't know how many of you got that damn valentine, but I tell you what, it meant a lot to me. [ Laughter ] I've received a lot of honors in my life, but that might be the best one I've ever received. [ Laughter ]
You know, yes, Ethel was Mrs. Robert Kennedy. She was one of my political—he was my—as I said, one of my political heroes. But I always knew her as Ethel Kennedy, a hero in her own right. I loved Bobby Kennedy. I've only met him once when I was in Syracuse law school and he was campaigning. But I just—I admired him so damn much.
I've told John Kerry this, my buddy. I could picture Bobby at my kitchen table with my dad and my mom. I could picture him there.
But you know, Ethel was a hero in her own right, full of character, full of integrity and empathy—and genuine empathy. She was full of laughter and joy and light. She was a great athlete in her own right, for real. She was a mother. Literally, there was nothing, from my perspective and, I suspect, most of you, that she couldn't do—nothing.
Four years later, after I had gotten—after Bobby—she lost her beloved Bobby, she invited me and my boys to her home after the accident left my family broken, having lost my wife and daughter, my boys barely making it. Along with Teddy, she got me through a time I didn't want to stick around. I wanted no part of being in the Congress or the Senate. I mean it.
I'd spoken to my Governor, because we had elected a Democratic Governor, to find a replacement for me. But Teddy and Ethel Kennedy would hear nothing—none of it. You know, the fact is, like she did for the country, Ethel helped my family find a way forward with principle and purpose.
We saw how she picked up Bobby's cause and stamped her own mark on the country. Marching for civil rights, as you heard about today, and working to end poverty at home, attempting to secure peace abroad, and so much more. She once said: ""For anyone to achieve something, you have to show a little courage. You're only on this Earth once. You must give it all you've got.""
Reminded me of my mom. My mom used to say: ""Joey, courage lives in every heart, and one day you'll be called upon. Be ready to stand up."" And that's not—that's from Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, and she meant it. She meant it.
For over 50 years, with Ethel's own iron will and moral courage, she gave it everything she had, and we're a better nation and a better world because of Ethel Kennedy.
Let me close with this. On a Sunday in May this year, I delivered a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta. I noted that had we been in church that day, there'd be a reflection about the Resurrection and redemption. We remember Jesus was buried on Friday, and on Sunday, He rose again. But we don't talk nearly enough about that Saturday when His disciples felt all hope was lost—all hope was lost.
In our lives and in the life of our Nation, we have those Saturdays—and thank God your mom, your grandmom, your great-grandmom was there for me—to bear witness to the day before glory, to see people's pain and not look away. But work is to be done on Saturday, is to move pain to purpose. How can faith get a person, get a nation through what is coming?
Well, my message to all of us here today and to the entire the country is, look to Ethel Kennedy's faith.
To the Kennedy family—presumptuous of me to say this and maybe sound inappropriate, but to the Kennedy family, the Biden family is here for you, as you've always been for us. You changed the life of my boys. You really did.
When I lost my son Beau, he was attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he volunteered to join the National Guard as attorney general. You either have to be State property or Federal property. And he temporarily gave up his office to go with his unit for a year in Iraq. And unfortunately, I was in—in out—in and out of Iraq, as Barack knows, because—and Afghanistan 30-some times. And I got to see him several times.
But the bad news was he was about a quarter to a half mile away from a burn pit—100 yards long, 10 feet deep, burning everything from waste to—everything, poisoning the air. And he came home with stage 4 glioblastoma, and he died. Your mom was there then too.
I apologize.
So, from the Biden family to the Kennedy family, the hymn that's very close to our heart based on the 91st Psalm, it goes like this: ""May he raise you up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you to shine like the Sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand.""
May God bless Ethel Kennedy, and may we—she—may be—she be reunited with the blessed pieces of her soul in Heaven.
God bless you all, and thank you for letting me participate. Thank you."
"December 19, 2023",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-former-supreme-court-associate-justice-sandra-day-oconnor,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"To the O'Connor family, my wife Jill and I send our love on behalf of a truly grateful Nation for her service. I'm humbled to be asked to speak today.
To the members of the clergy, the Chief Justice, Justices of the Supreme Court past and present, members of the bench and bar, Members of the Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans. More than 40 years ago, on a Wednesday in September 1981, the Senate Judiciary Committee came to order.
I was the ranking member of that Committee, and the day's business was momentous: the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to become the first woman in American History to serve as a Supreme Court Justice on the United States Supreme Court.
Announcing her nomination earlier that summer, President Reagan described her as, and I quote, ""a person for all seasons."" And it was a person for all seasons whom we saw in that hearing and the Americans and the world would see through her extraordinary service as a Justice and, I might add, as a citizen.
Gracious and wise, civil and principled, Sandra Day O'Connor, a daughter of the American West, was a pioneer in her own right, breaking down the barriers in legal and political worlds and the Nation's consciousness.
To her, the Supreme Court was bedrock, the bedrock of America. It was a vital—a vital—line of defense for the values and the vision of our Republic, devoted not to the pursuit of power for power's sake, but to make real the promise of America: the American promise that holds that we're all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
The High Court, she said in her opening statement, and I quote, ""is the body to which all Americans look for the ultimate protection of their rights. It is the United States Supreme Court that we all turn when we seek that which we want most from our Government: equal justice under law."" End of quote.
Equal justice under law is the noble—the noblest aspiration of humankind and the aspiration of Sandra Day O'Connor, one that she pursued her whole life. The last Justice to have held elected office, she was especially conscious of the law's real impact on people's lives.
One need not agree with all her decisions in order to recognize that her principles were deeply held and of the highest order and that her desire for civility was genuine. And her trust in the capacity of human institutions to make life better is what this world—was abiding.
And how she embodied such attributes under such pressure and scrutiny helped empower generations of women in every part of American life, including the Court itself, helping to open doors, secure freedoms, and prove that a woman can not only do anything a man can do but, many times, do it a hell of a lot—a heck of a lot better. [ Laughter ] Excuse my language, Father.
Beyond the bench, Justice O'Connor valued the civic life of the Nation: in our schools and our community centers, in families and in our friendships. Yes, America is the land of rugged individualists, adventurers, and entrepreneurs. But she knew no person is an island.
In the fabric of our Nation, we're all inextricably linked. And for the America to thrive, America must see themselves not as enemies but as partners in the great work of deciding our collective destiny. That's the essence of our national experience, the sacred cause of democracy she devoted her life to, one that we must continue.
I'll close with how she closed her opening statement on that September day 42 years ago. She spoke about the power of family, family being the hope of the world, the strength of community, the relationship between ourselves and generations who follow.
To her sons—Scott, Brian, and Jay—how she admired your intellect and, you may recall, at that hearing, your sense of adventure. [ Laughter ] We all saw on that day and all those years after how much she loved your dad, a brilliant lawyer who always, always supported her.
To the entire family, including the grandchildren, I know how hard all these years have been to watch a disease that robbed them both and all of you of so very much.
But I hope—I hope—you hold on to what is never truly lost: the love both of them had for you and the love you had for them, a love they shared so freely and a love you returned with equal devotion. What a gift. What a gift.
And I hope you find comfort in another profound consequence of her service: the countless families that she helped by speaking so openly about your family's experiences. It matters.
In that opening statement, on that day in September, she mentioned how your parents got married in December. Here we gather today, a day before it would have been their 71st [70th; White House correction] wedding anniversary.
I know the anniversaries and the birthdays, the moments big and small, will be hard without them. But as a saying goes, memory is the power to gather roses in winter.
I hope you find the strength in knowing that your mom and dad are together again this December, gathering roses in winter once again as great Americans, both great Americans for all seasons.
May God bless Sandra Day O'Connor, an American pioneer."
"January 12, 2023",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-former-secretary-defense-ashton-b-carter,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"This is beyond my capacity to accurately assess what an incredible man Ash was. Ash was a force. He was a force of nature. His genius was evident, his integrity unfailing, and his commitment to service before self was literally inspiring.
I know we can all still picture Ash as he was until the very end.
Professor Carter: packing students into his classroom in Cambridge, guiding them forward toward a life of service.
Secretary Carter: advising both me and Secretary Austin on technology and innovation. Austin got it quicker than Biden, but—Doctor Carter: harnessing his incredible intellect to sharpen our cutting edge as a Nation and to make sure—make sure America always leads the world with both our power but also our purpose.
I wish so deeply that Ash had lived to enjoy the new honorific—one he was looking forward to—of being grandfather. But he's smiling right now, and he's looking down. And he'll be there.
Will, Ava—you were his heart. He filled every office—at least I was ever in—with your photos. I kept asking, ""Who's that big guy?"" [ Laughter ] He loved seeing you—he loved seeing you blaze your own trails in the world, together with your wonderful spouses, Mariah and Surya.
And I think the reason he talked to me about it is—you know me, I never talk about my children. [ Laughter ]
But, Clayton, you and Ash parented two exceptional kids together. Corinne and Cynthia, you were with Ash from the very beginning. As I told you downstairs, I was lucky, as well. I had sisters better looking and smarter than me. And so did he. And he relied on you. Watching your little brother—your little brother chart his phenomenal path from theoretical physics to the world of science, but the world—to a world leader.
And, Stephanie, everyone could see: He cherished you. He cherished you. You made him whole.
I have some idea—and every case is not the same—but how hard this is, how unreal and unfair it seems, to lose someone you love so suddenly, someone who should have had so many years ahead of them. The suddenness, in my view, magnifies the grief. It makes it just inescapable.
And on behalf of our Nation, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for sharing Ash with us and for your own service to our country. We're truly grateful.
Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, Secretary McDonough, Secretary Mayorkas, Director Haines, General Milley, General Dunford, Members of Congress, and all the distinguished leaders from across the Government, our military, and private sector and academia: Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man."" An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.
He might have been talking about Ash, but nowhere more than the Department of Defense. Over the course of four decades, working in and out of the Pentagon, walking miles and miles of laps, Ash made an impact felt far into the future.
Ash always took the hardest jobs, the seemingly impossible missions, because he believed he could make a difference. And he did make a difference.
I stand here today as Commander in Chief of, as Ash always said, the ""finest fighting force the world has ever known."" And that is not hyperbole. The finest fighting force the world has ever known. A force made stronger and more inclusive by Ash's principles and convictions. A force made up of warriors who are safer because of Ash's determination to protect them and give them what they needed. A force and a department forever shaped by Ash's far-reaching vision and his relentless—relentless—innovation.
He believed, as I do, in what America can achieve when we put our minds to it. He believed not just in getting things done, but getting things done in record time, which I'm sure those who worked for him found very interesting sometimes. I've got a lot of you—[ laughter ]—laughter on this side.
As many of you know well, he took personal pleasure in busting through bureaucratic redtape to deliver results. And woe unto the staffer who failed to follow through on an assignment that Ash had given them. Dean, as they say in my church, ""Bless me Father, for they have sinned.""
But I'm serious—I see some people nodding in recognition—he was an incredible guy.
Ash was a scientist, first and always. A truth seeker, a teacher. That training shaped his leadership. And he sought to understand a problem from every angle. He took the time then to explain his thinking. And he never let politics or expediency color his recommendation. He always followed where the facts led him. And sometimes there were places we didn't want to go.
That's what made his counsel so valuable to President Obama and to me, as Vice President, and so many other leaders. Ash felt a duty to deliver his best possible analysis and recommendation with exceptional candor, with exceptional discretion, and above all, with exceptional integrity.
As I told Stephanie when I called her the morning after Ash passed, that's actually the first thing I think of when I think of Ash. I think of a word—no, seriously: integrity. His integrity. It was indomitable. And I never, ever had to wonder—I've been doing this job a long—not as President, but in high public office. Never had to wonder whether there was an edge to it, whether there was a secondary motive I didn't see. How he matched his scientific principles with a straightforward moral conviction that truth, honesty, and decency matter.
And how Ash never lost sight of what his work at the Pentagon meant for the safety of the American people—whether he was serving with a—his mentor and great friend, Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, in the nineties to reduce the risks of nuclear proliferation after the Soviet Union collapsed, or when Ash became Secretary himself in 2015, taking the fight to ISIS to smash their hold on territories in Iraq and Syria and keep America safe from terrorist threats.
Above all, Ash had an unmistakable commitment to his troops, who put their lives on the line for our country every single day. Ash understood to his core that we had a sacred—we have a sacred obligation to give them what they need and support they need when we send them into harm's way.
As a nation—you've heard me say it, but I heard him say it in a similar way—we have many obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they return home.
And there is no greater example of this than Ash's tendencies when it came to getting our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles—MRAPs.
Tony and others remember. We were working together. I became the pain in the neck for everybody by pushing this so hard, but I had a little guy with a—a guy whispering in my ear. There were—some thought there were other priorities first, but not Ash.
In the early 2000s, 60 or 70—60 to 70 percent of our troop casualties were from road IEDs—improvised explosive devices—that would rip through the—our Humvees, as well as our troops who were riding in them.
I led the fight on the Senate floor in 2007 to make sure we were forward-funding the production of these MRAPs. I believed, along with the Commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, that we had, and I quote, a ""moral imperative"" to speed up their delivery to get our troops this critical equipment that would literally save—and literally did save—countless American lives and limbs.
But by the time the O-Biden—the Obama-Biden administration took office in 2009, the production and delivery of MRAPs to the field was still going too slowly. All that changed when Ash became the ""acquisitions czar."" It all changed. He made his mission to ""work at war speed"" to get our warfighters the best possible protection we could give them as fast as possible.
And he was personally engaged, refining and improving the design of the to make them safer and easier to maneuver—when—maneuver. When Ash learned that the troops in the field were having an issue with visibility, he was at the R&D facility the very next day. He was there to see the problem for himself, ride the vehicle—in the vehicle, and get it done.
In 2012, Ash had been promoted to Deputy Secretary. By that time, we had deployed more than 24,000 MRAPs. Casualty rates among troops transported by MRAPs came down by as much as 75 percent compared to those riding in Humvees. Ash got it done.
And as I told the family when I met them beforehand, I have a—probably, I don't know, 3½, 4-foot-long by 10 inches high, maybe a foot high, photograph of MRAPs lined up side by side with a note from Ash saying: ""Thanks. Ash Carter."" I have it hanging in my office at home—in my home.
You know, it's amazing what he did with his background as a scientist. I just—he got it done. And he literally saved, I think, in consequence of it, hundreds and hundreds, thousands of lives and limbs. He protected our servicemembers' futures because they were out defending ours.
How many Americans are alive today welcoming children of their own because of Ash Carter. How many of them who came home bearing the scars of war have memories of Ash at their bedside—Stephanie right there with him—as they recovered at Walter Reed and other places around the world?
All those quiet visits to Walter Reed—without the press, without any fanfare, standing long before he became Secretary. Holding the hands of wounded warriors. Hugging the family members and keeping them close. Listening to their stories, which they want to tell and we should listen to. And finding something to smile about together, despite their pain.
Ash's connection to our troops and their families was more than a professional duty. To him, it was personal.
And to Stephanie: You were fundamental to that. You helped Ash to bring his fullest self to his service. He could not have been the Secretary of Defense that he was, the mentor he was, the man he was, without your love and support. It meant so much to so many.
Remember Emerson: ""An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man."" And it was a long shadow.
Or as Ash sometimes told his students, ""You are my legacy now."" You are my legacy now. And how many of them are.
Each of us here today—generations of national security leaders, decades of eager and brilliant students, the entire Armed Forces of the United States of America—we all will forever bear the imprint of Ash Carter, thank God.
May we continue to carry the legacy of Ash with us in our hearts. May we be guided by his foresight, his ferocious mind, fortified by his integrity. And may we always seek the truth. May we always strive to be of service.
May God bless Ash Carter, a dear friend, a great American. And may God continue to protect our troops, who Ash so loved and loved him back."
"May 01, 2022","Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale in Minneapolis, Minnesota",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-former-vice-president-walter-f-mondale-minneapolis-minnesota,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Thank you. Thank you, Amy. What Fritz is really saying looking down is, ""Joe, hide your Irish Catholic enthusiasm a little bit and be more Norwegian."" [ Laughter ]
A generous introduction. You know, we got a chance to talk with the family a little bit earlier and trying to console them, and I got emotional. But as my Grandfather Finnegan would say, ""That's the Irish of it."" [ Laughter ]
You know, I served with Fritz a long time. He became a good and close friend. I was a kid when I got elected. I wasn't even old enough to be sworn in. I was only 29 years old. And because everything is based on seniority in the Senate, I got to hang out with folks like Fritz and Hubert long before you'd ordinarily at my age—because by the time I was there a second term, I was chairman of some major committees.
And so I'm going to talk more today about Fritz and what he pretend didn't exist but Fritz's sense of empathy. Fritz had a special way about him that I don't think he would talk about. I could be wrong, but I never heard him talk about it.
You know, there was a question that Fritz famously asked staffers who came to work for him. He'd say, ""On the breakfast plate, what's the difference between the eggs and the bacon?"" Senator Smith and Klobuchar know the answer. [ Laughter ] By supplying the eggs, the chicken made a contribution. The hog was fully committed. [ Laughter ]
And it always surprised Fritz I knew a little about agriculture. Delaware, my State, has a—the Delmarva Peninsula has a $5 billion industry: chickens. A lot of chickens, a hell of a lot more chickens than people. And it's the biggest industry.
But Fritz was always committed not merely to the work of his lifetime, which all of you are familiar with. Most people know, most of all, everybody was blessed to know him in this State.
You know, Reverend Hart-Andersen, Members of Congress and our military, distinguished guests; most of all, the Mondale family—Ted and William, and Rebecca and Chan; all the grandchildren—Louis, Amanda, Berit, Charlotte, Cassandra, Danielle; and all the dear friends of the family that are here as well, because he always talked about you all as family: I'm moved to be with you here today as an—honor one of the great giants in American history. And that's not hyperbole. Fritz was a giant in American political history.
You know, a great American who—but he also had a lot of great Americans write about him and write things that related to him without them even knowing it. The great American novelist Edith Wharton wrote, ""There are two ways of spreading light: to be a candle or the mirror that reflects it."" Fritz was both the candle and the mirror, in my view, a candle spreading light and the mirror reflecting it. And today I speak of a friend of five decades, about that light, the light of friendship and what it meant to me personally, to my family.
Fritz and I first met in one of the darkest moments of my life. I had not intended to run for the United States Senate. I was involved—my State, to its great shame, was segregated by law. We have the eighth largest Black population in America as a percent of population in Delaware. I got involved in politics indirectly by getting involved in the civil rights movement as a kid, being the only White employee in east side of Wilmington, an area called ""The Bucket,"" for years.
And I was asked by a group of senior Democrats would I—I was a young lawyer when I came back from law school. And we were the only city in America occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with every corner being occupied by a National Guard member with a drawn bayonet because of Dr. King's assassination and the riots that took place in my home State.
And I had a job with one of the oldest law firms in the State, a ""white shoe,"" as they used to call them, law firm. And after being home for 6 months, I couldn't do it anymore. And I left and tried to—sought a job as a public defender to represent the people I used to work with in the—as a kid in high school and college.
And so I came to the United States Senate with a passion to do something about civil rights. And when I was elected, I ran initially for the group—with a group I joined, a group of senior members of the United States—of the Delaware Democratic establishment to reform the Democratic Party, because we were more a southern Democratic Party than a northeastern Democratic Party. You used to be able to be joined—the Southern Governors' Conference with the Mid-Atlantic Conference. And Democratic Governors joined the Southern Governors' Conference.
But I couldn't bring myself to be a Republican, even though they were more progressive, because of Richard Nixon when I registered.
But I was asked to head up a committee of younger people to try to get someone to run for the United States Senate against a guy who was a decent guy, actually. A little too conservative, but a decent guy. And one thing led to another, and I ended up being asked to run for the Senate. I had no intention of running for the Senate.
But, 2 years earlier, I had been elected to the county council. And Delaware is like a miniature Illinois. One county is 60 percent of the State's population. So, as a councilperson, I represented a district seven times as large as a State representative and three times as large as a State senator.
And I ran and won. I ran only to be a good soldier to try to get out Democrats voting. And I wasn't supposed to win. The only reason I ran—I was certain I wasn't going to win—because I didn't want to be a county councilman. [ Laughter ] I wanted—I was just setting up a law firm as a young Senator—as a young man, I should say.
And so what happened was, I won in a district that was, like, 55-, 56-percent Republican. No Democrat had ever won. Republicans saw something in me I didn't see: They saw someone who may want to go on and run for office beyond that, so they reapportioned me from a 4-year term to a 2-year term, you know, 65-percent district.
And I was put in a position of up or out. And a group of senior members—a former Governor, a former United States Senator, a former Congressman, and the Chief Justice of the—retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, whose family had more Senators than any family in American history. And they came to me—an off-year convention.
I'll never forget I was—how classic it was. I was—there was a break in the convention in Dover, Delaware. I was at a little motel nearby. Had to go back and change with the younger people I was with. And I had my own room. And you know, the typical kind of—you drive up to the front door, two headboards nailed on the wall, a desk nailed to the other wall, and an 8-by-10 bathroom.
So I was in, shaving. I had my towel around. Man, I just got a shower and shaving, and I—there's banging at the door. And I thought it was one of those—a guy named Bob Cunningham was with me. I said, ""All right, all right, all right."" I went to the door and opened the door. There was a former two-term Governor named Elbert—Elbert Carvel, a former Congressman named Harrison, and the State chairman, and a former Chief Justice.
And I'm standing in a towel, shaving, and my—[ laughter ]—and the rest of me stark naked. And I said—they said, ""We want to talk to you, Joe."" So I said, ""Well, come in, gentlemen."" I ran into the bathroom, take off the shaving cream, hoping I can find something to put on. I had nothing to put on. [ Laughter ]
So I came back out, and I leaned against that desk and with a towel around me. I said, ""Yes, gentlemen?"" [ Laughter ] And they said: ""Joe, we just had dinner. We think you should run for the Senate."" And I said, ""But""—and the Chief Justice—former Chief Justice—[ inaudible ]—said that. I said, ""Sir."" I said, ""I'm not old enough."" He said, ""Joe, you obviously didn't do very well on constitutional law."" [ Laughter ] I'm thinking, ""Holy God, what did I do now?"" [ Laughter ] And he said, ""You only have to be 30 to be sworn in. They can elect you whenever you want. You'll be 30 17 days later.
Well, I ran, and, to the shock and surprise of everybody, I won by a staggering 3,100 votes.
But here's the point: I showed up on December 18 to hire staff. I hadn't been sworn in yet. And what happened was that I had gotten a phone call that day from my fire department in Delaware. And they put a poor young woman on the phone who said: ""You've got to come home. There's been an accident."" And she went on to tell me—the poor kid had to tell me there was an accident. I asked, ""What happened?"" She said, ""Your wife and daughter are dead, and your two boys may not make it.""
And you know, the last thing I wanted to do was go to the United States Senate after that. We had elected a Governor, a Democrat. He could appoint a Democrat. And I had my brother talking to him about who we'd appoint.
But there was Fritz and Joan. They embraced me, contacted me. And it's not just being nice, but bringing me in. They came to the hospital to see my boys. They helped me find my purpose in a sea of darkness and pain.
And along—I was with Fritz, along with Mike Mansfield and Teddy Kennedy and a few others who all came to see me and said: ""Just come 6 months. You can go home after that. We need you."" We had 58 Democrats; they didn't need me for a damn thing. [ Laughter ] No, I'm serious. But I was so—such a rookie I thought, ""Maybe they need me to organize."" [ Laughter ] And they said, ""Then you can leave.""
And I used to show up every Tuesday at 3 o'clock in the Senate Chamber to get an assignment from Senator Mansfield. Many times, Fritz would walk me over. And I thought all freshmen got assignments. I didn't know that nobody gets an assignment in the Senate. [ Laughter ] It wasn't until about 5 months or 3 months in that I realized that was the case.
But they kept me engaged. They helped me get up when it was easy to give up.
My life changed again 5 years later. No man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two, but I met and married Jill Biden. I had to ask her five times. [ Laughter ] True. But being a spouse of a Senator who was relatively well known, because of the celebrity of how I got there and the accident, and inheriting two beautiful young boys wasn't easy.
Once again, Fritz and Joan were there spreading the light. Joan was one of the first people to reach out to Jill, and it meant the world to us. It meant the world.
You just heard from my friend, Jon Meacham, Fritz was a master legislator who shone a light on those who needed it most. The desire to lift up others stemmed from his youth, from his service as a corporal in the U.S. Army and those early days organizing for Hubert Humphrey in parts of Minnesota that Democrats didn't win.
Fritz learned early the power of bringing people together. And I know that Fritz—for Fritz, no moment was brighter than when he joined forces—because I was with him; I was just a bit player—with an African American Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Edward Brooke, and they passed the Fair Housing Act.
I was on the same side—the same side of the Chamber in the back where Fritz was. I remember the look on his face—literally remember the look on his face. Opened up neighborhoods diminished by segregation for so long. When the Act passed, Fritz spoke on the Senate floor. And he said that, quote, ""The words 'justice' and 'fairness' will mean more to millions of our fellow Americans than they do—will never—meant more to our fellow Americans than they do today."" That was Fritz spreading light, the light of our country, to families who had never truly known its warmth.
At every stage of our lives, at every inflection point, Fritz and Joan—I apologize, as we say in the Senate, for the, you know, point of personal privilege here—but they were there for Jill and me and my family—not on a political level, but on a personal level. It was true that my—first days in the Senate when I needed help very badly, and it was true in my last days in the Senate as well.
In 2008—and Fritz and I had become close friends, and I sought his counsel many times—I was asked to join the ticket with Barack Obama. I was, as I usually was, on Amtrak going home. [ Laughter ] I commuted every day. They later told me over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak. They should name a station or something after me. [ Laughter ]
But all kidding aside, he called me after it was clear he was the de facto nominee. And he said he'd liked me to join him on the ticket, at least consider it; could he do a background check on me. ""You know, we have to do that background check."" And I said, ""No thanks, Barack."" I thought he was just dragging that bloody cloth through the Senate like President—Presidential nominees do to get everybody excited and involved.
And Barack told me, ""No, no, no, there's only one other person I'm considering."" I said, ""Barack, I don't want to be Vice President."" He said, ""Why?"" I said, ""Because you're basically just standby equipment."" [ Laughter ] I said, ""What I want to do—I'm""—and by that time, I had chaired two major committees. I was fairly influential in the Senate. I said: ""I can help you a lot more as a Senator. I'll do everything I can. I'll campaign throughout the country for you.""
Barack asked me—he said: ""Look, would you go home and talk it over with your family? Just talk it over."" So I did. I called Jill from the train on my cell phone. And when I got home—I was about halfway home when I had gotten the call. And when I got home, I went in. And the first person I called was Fritz before the family gathered in the back porch. And I asked, I said, ""Fritz, what should I do?"" And he went into great detail. [ Laughter ] I'm serious. As a matter of fact, he sent me a long memorandum he prepared for President Carter when they were deciding how the relationship would work.
He told me, in essence, that the Vice Presidency holds no inherent power. None. Zero. The Vice President is merely—and it's true—a reflection of your relationship with the President of the United States.
About 7 years ago, I joined Fritz at a forum in his honor at George Washington University. Fritz recounted that his greatest strength wasn't his expertise in a particular policy area; it was the genuine personal relationship he built with President Jimmy Carter, a relationship built on real affection and trust. They sat down for lunch together every week. Fritz said, ""Make sure you get a commitment from Barack: Once a week, you have lunch to discuss whatever is on either of your minds.""
He was the first Vice President to have an office in the West Wing, just a few steps away from the Oval Office. That had never happened before. They were over in the Executive Office Building across the street.
That was the true strength of the Vice Presidency he said, a strength that Barack and I replicated in our time in office and what I'm—Kamala and I are doing today. And she sends her regards to the whole family. She called me before I got in the plane.
It was Fritz who lit the way. His core—at his core, Fritz embraced everybody with a belief that everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity—everybody. Dignity. Not just the right to vote, dignity. He was loved by the American people because he reflected the goodness of the American people, especially the people of Minnesota.
You know, every Senator wears on his or her sleeve the State they serve. But the love Fritz had for the people of Minnesota ran deeper than that. He loved you all, and you loved him back—it was obvious—because Fritz reflected the very best qualities of this State: the warmth and optimism that you reflect.
At every turn, Fritz reflected the light of this Nation, who we are and what we can be. He called me when I had said in the Inauguration that we're the most unique nation in all of history. We're the only nation founded on an idea. Every other nation in the world is based on geography, ethnicity, religion, race. We're founded on an idea. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" that all men and women are created equal, ""endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,"" including the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. And it goes on.
Fritz believed that in his gut. I watched him every day for over 35 years in the Senate and when he was Vice President. He united people, sharing the same light, the same hopes. Even when we disagree, he thought that was important.
I'll never forget, on a personal level, what it meant to have a friend like Fritz. Less than 4 years after losing Eleanor to brain cancer and just a year after losing Joan, Fritz was there to help me again when Jill and I lost our son Beau to brain cancer after a year in Iraq.
I'll never forget how Fritz reflected so much love and light into our family—again, at our darkest moments—nor will I forget coming here to Minneapolis 8 years ago to say goodbye to Joan.
Most of you remember that Fritz went to the Mayo Clinic for quadruple bypass the very next day. He had delayed the surgery so he could be with all of us to reflect her light. And he put off treating his own heart because, as all you know, his heart belonged to Joan.
As I've said many times—I say to the family, seeing your mom and dad together reminded me of that great line from Christopher Marlowe's poem: ""Come live with me and be my love, and we shall all the pleasures prove."" You can tell when a couple has been together a long time, still looks at each other with love, deep love.
It's been said that memory is the power to gather roses in winter. Well, Ted and William, your dad blessed you with an endless garden of those memories and, most of all, the memory of two extraordinary loves: a love of more than 58 years he spent together with your mom and a love of 51 years with your sister Eleanor. In his farewell letter, Fritz wrote that he was eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor, two unbreakable loves.
You know, Jill Biden wanted to do a garden at the Vice President's Residence—a picture of which shows on the screen outside here that I'm standing in front of the Residence—so that every family that ever had lived there, there was a garden with stones and engraving on each of the stones with the name of the couple and the children.
And I called Fritz to tell him about it; he came over to the house. And it was a summer day. And he wanted—he said, ""Can we go in the house?"" I said, ""Of course."" He wanted to walk up to the third floor. He walked up to the third floor and then, to the end; there are bedrooms in the third floor.
And he stopped in front of a door and opened it and just stared. And I knew he was thinking something deeply, and I went down the hallway. And a few minutes went by, and he came down. And he said: ""That was Eleanor's room. I so miss her."" Well, they're all together now, for all time.
Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man."" There is no doubt that the institution of the Senate and the institution of the Vice President reflect the profound legacy of Fritz Mondale.
But it's not a lengthened shadow we see in those places, it's his light. And it's up to each of us now to reflect that light that Fritz was all about, to reflect Fritz's goodness and grace, the way he made people feel no matter who you were.
Just imagine what our Nation could achieve if we followed Fritz's example of honor, decency, integrity, literally just the service to the common good. There would be nothing—nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our reach.
I hope we all can be Fritz's mirror, continue to spread his light. Because you know he was one of the finest men you've ever known, one of the most decent people I ever dealt with, and one of the toughest, smartest men I've ever worked with. You were lucky to have had him. [ Inaudible ]—look at things, he was lucky to have had you.
God bless you, my dear friend. Among the greatest of all Americans. The highest compliment, my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, you can give a man or a woman—he was—the Irish of it is to say, ""He's a good man.""
Fritz Mondale was a good man."
"April 27, 2022",Remarks at the Funeral Service of Former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-former-secretary-state-madeleine-k-albright,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Freedom endures against all odds in the face of every aggressor because there are always those who will fight for that freedom. And in the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright.
Anne, Alice, Katie: Your mom was a force, a force of nature. With her goodness and grace, her humanity, and her intellect, she turned the tide of history.
David, Daniel, Jack, Jake, Ben, and Ellie: You're too young to remember this, but when the Iron Curtain fell and the Berlin Wall came down, our world faced one of those inflection points, a once-in-a-generation moment of upheaval, but opportunity as well. People and nations around the world were deciding the future they wanted to make for themselves. And your grandmother—your grandmother—as Madam Ambassador and as the first female Secretary of State in American history, made sure those nations and those people knew exactly where the United States of America stood and what we stood for.
You know, and all through it, her beloved sister Kathy and her brother John can attest, she never forgot where she came from or who she was.
President Obama, President and Secretary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Members of Congress, Cabinet members past and present: Today we honor a truly proud American who made all of us prouder to be Americans.
I also want to welcome the distinguished guests and dignitaries who have traveled from around the world to celebrate a daughter of the Czech Republic who knew—who knew—what it meant to endure war and flee persecution.
With her friend Vaclav Havel—when he died, I remember, when Madeleine eulogized him, she used these words, and I quote: ""He cast light into places of deepest darkness and reminded us constantly of our obligations to one another."" These words—these words—apply equally to Madeleine.
When I got word that Madeleine had passed, I was in midair on my way to Europe to meet with our NATO allies in Brussels to help try to continue to keep the strong, strong alliances together, our organization and international response to Russia's brutal and unjustifiable war against Ukraine. And it was not lost on me that Madeleine was a big part of the reason NATO was still strong and galvanized, as it is today.
And a few days later, I traveled to Poland and spoke about all that was at stake in our world and for democracy and freedom, which is under assault from forces of autocracy and oppression. Many are tired of hearing me say I think we're at another inflection point in world history, where there is literally a severe confrontation between autocrats and democratic nations. President Clinton—Bill—it was not lost on me that you spoke at the same Warsaw castle that I was about to speak at 25 years earlier.
In my case, it was evening. That interior of the castle, that beautiful courtyard, holds about five, six hundred people. And mostly Poles and Ukrainians were present when I spoke. And I'm sure many in the audience spoke English, though likely not their first language.
But when I mentioned the name—they were respectful of what I was saying—but when I mentioned the name of Madeleine Albright, there was a deafening cheer. They all stopped everything and started to cheer. It was spontaneous. It was real. For her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world.
Madeleine never minced words or wasted time when she saw something needed fixing or someone who needed helping. She just got to work.
And as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from the time I was a kid—God, they were the good old days. [ Laughter ] I was the chairman or the ranking member for a good part of that time. And in the nineties, I can attest that Madeleine, with the significant help of the President of the United States, kept the committee really busy.
In our work to halt genocide in the Balkans, support new democracies in Eastern and Central Europe, to develop Plan Colombia—in all of those undertakings, Madeleine was an incomparable ally and adviser, beyond the President, to me and to others on the committee.
She always had a knack for explaining to the American people why it mattered to them that people everywhere in the world were struggling to breathe free. And Madeleine didn't stop when she left Government. For decades, she was a nexus of the foreign policy community, always—and I mean always—on top of the latest developments, always speaking out for democracy, and always the first to sound the alarm about fascism.
Presidents and leaders around the world continued to solicit her advice, including me, when I asked her last year to chair the Defense Policy Board. She built businesses. She pumped out New York Times bestsellers that were both highly prescient and deeply salient—and constantly bestsellers. I think I've read them all.
You know—and she mentored generations of rising foreign policy experts, the, quote, ""foreign policy establishment."" You know—and the thing that I noted that was deliberate and remarkable about her, not unlike Secretary Clinton, was that she made sure that young women knew they belonged at every single table having to do with national security, without exception.
Today, across our Government and around the world, Madeleine's proteges are legion. Many are here today, each carrying with them a spark lit by her passion and her brilliance.
I think part of the reason why Madeleine was such a successful diplomat was that she understood something I've always believed. And my boss, President Obama, when I was Vice President, used to kid me because I'd repeat so often, because I believed she understood something I've always believed: that all politics, especially international politics, is personal. It all, ultimately, is personal.
She could go toe to toe with the toughest dictators, then turn around and literally teach a fellow Ambassador how to do the macarena on the floor of the U.N. Security Council. [ Laughter ] You all think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. She thought it was too difficult to teach me how to dance though. [ Laughter ] She was right.
No matter where she was, she understood people. She cared about people. And all of that was grounded in an education gained by watching her father, Josef Korbel—and her mentor as well. She learned diplomacy at the dinner table. And throughout her life, nothing mattered to Madeleine more than the family—nothing.
Madeleine had the same rule that I do and others here do: No matter what's happening in my day—as President Obama can tell you—or who I'm meeting with, if one of my children calls, I take the call. She was the same way.
Anne, Alice, Katie, and your grandchildren, each of you—each of you—is literally a tribute to her enormous capacity to love. I know it's hard, but I promise you: She's always with you, in your mind, in your heart, and part of your soul. And I promise you: You're going to have a tough decision, and you're going to be asking yourself, ""What would she want me to do?"" Not a joke. Remember I said it. That's going to happen.
And, Kathy and John, the connection the three of you maintained through your lives was always an anchor to Madeleine, through all the ups and downs of life. What a gift. What a gift. What a family.
You know, from that first trans-Atlantic crossing on the SS America , to landing in nations around the world in that big blue-and-white plane emblazoned with the words ""United States of America,"" Madeleine understood her story was America's story. Her story was America's story.
She loved to speak about America as the ""indispensable nation."" To her, the phrase was never a statement of arrogance. It was about gratitude for all this country made possible for her. It was a testament to her belief in the endless possibilities that only America could help unlock around the world and her to—understanding of what American power could achieve when it was united with and motivated by enduring American values.
That's why there was nothing she loved more than swearing in new citizens to this great Nation of ours. She'd light up, reminding them that she once stood where they stood. Having gained the blessings of liberty, she wanted nothing more than to share them around the globe.
To Madeleine, from my prospective, there was no higher mission, no greater honor than to serve this great experiment in freedom known as the United States of America. May her memory continue to be a blessing to our Nation, and may we remember her words and her deeds. May she always be a light to all those in the darkest places, a reminder of our obligation to one another.
May God bless Madeleine Albright."

Jill and I are here for Harry, but he—if he would—he wouldn't want us to really be here for just him, as everybody has referenced. Landra, we're here for you and for the family. Eulogies are for the living.
You know it's a true love story when you're still talking about your first date 60 years later, Gov. Harry never tired of telling of the time you two kids had to push-start his car, making your way down the road with wide smiles on your face. My recollection is, he called it, when he told me the story, one of those, quote, ""moments that turn a life and that stay with you until the last breath."" Landra, what a life you turned together until his last breath.
To Lana and Rory and Leif, Josh, Key, all the grandchildren, great-grandchildren: Seeing and hearing you talk about him today, it's clear. My dad used to have an expression. He'd say you are blood of his blood, bone of his bone. You are the product of Harry and Landra Reid. What a gift. What a gift God gave you. What a gift that was and is.
Elder Ballard; President Obama; Vice President Harris; Second Gentleman; Governor Sisolak, thanks for the passport into the State; and Iris and Chuck Schumer; and Paul and Nancy Pelosi; Members of the Nevada congressional delegation; Senator Cortez Masto and Rosen; and Representatives—excuse me—Horsford and Lee and Titus; Members of Congress—Democrat and Republican, past and present; and distinguished guests: What a gift Harry Reid was to this State and to this Nation and to so many of us individually.
I know he's smiling right now. Only Harry Reid, at his sendoff, would sandwich a speaker between a former President of the United States, Carole King, and the Killers. [ Laughter ] Thanks, Harry. [ Laughter ] You've always had a great sense of humor. [ Laughter ] You always had to win, and you always did. He got me again, but he always got me.
The first time I met Harry, I got a call asking whether as—I had just been elected, at 29 years old, to the United States Senate; I hadn't even turned 32 yet. He was a newly—I was a newly elected Senator. And he asked me to campaign for his election for Nevada's Senate seat being vacated by a man I'd only just begun to know, Alan Bible.
The first thing when he met—when I met him in Nevada, we were talking about where he's from, and he said, ""Well, I used to have a go out and shoot mad dogs."" And I thought, ""What in the hell am I doing here?"" [ Laughter ] I swear to God. ""I used to go out and shoot mad dogs."" And I'm thinking: ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. What's going on?"" [ Laughter ]
Harry lost that general election by less than 600 votes to Paul Laxalt. And he never let me forget thinking that I'd probably cost him those 600 votes. [ Laughter ] I'm only kidding about that piece, but I probably did.
But when he asked me to come back and campaign for him when he ran for the House in 1982, he won that time, and then he won in '86. And we'd go on to serve in Congress together for more than 30 years. We worked together with Barack during the 8 years we were in office.
And even when Harry was done in the Senate, he was never really done, as all of you from Nevada know. He'd ask me to campaign for an awful lot of Nevada Democrats, many of whom are here today. I could never say no, although you probably said, ""Oh, God, he invited Biden into my district?""
But I talked to him often during this last election, taking his advice—and Landra can tell you—of coming to his home on more than one occasion to visit and get his advice and where I should be going in order to win.
After we won, one of the things that Harry did—which was sort of incongruous with Harry, as you've heard today—he sent me a text. I've saved it. He said: ""I'm so proud. Joe, you're my brother. We won."" Well, it made a big deal to me—it was a big deal to me that he felt that way. I know Harry never wrote what he didn't believe. It made me feel good.
And he gave me a sense of confidence. It felt like he was my brother. I counted on him. And I know so many of you felt that same way about Harry as well throughout his career and your great relationship with him.
Over five decades, we became genuine friends: the Irish Catholic kid from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the Latter-day Saint from Searchlight. [ Laughter ] You think I'm kidding? Harry was like the guys I grew up with back in Scranton and in Claymont, Delaware. Harry would always have your back like the guys I grew up with. Harry had mine, and he knew I had his.
Although, I sometimes wondered, when I was trying to make an important point to Harry, about whether he really did have my back as he hung up. But to tell you the truth, every time—every time he would do it, I knew it was real—the real Harry. It was him.
He had all he needed. He didn't want any more or need any more. And we did share some similarities. As Barack said, we have loving families, wives that are smarter and better looking than we were. And Harry and I both liked to talk a lot. I'm just testing whether you're asleep yet. [ Laughter ]
But whether you served with Harry for decades or you were new to America just a few days ago, you wanted Harry in your corner. And that's not hyperbole.
His toughness was distinctively Nevadan. His story was unmistakably American. His remarkable journey has been told so many—by so many because it has been traveled by so few. The desert shack he called home. The miles he hitchhiked to school. A boxing ring where he always got up. The family tragedies he endured. The cancer he and Landra fought. The halls of power he walked. The State he transformed. The country he shaped. He was proof that there is nothing ordinary about America.
Ordinary Americans can do anything given half a chance. ""We, the People"" are pretty damn extraordinary. America is an idea. An idea that anybody, given a shot, can reach their potential.
Harry was extraordinary though. He and I grew up on different sides of the country, but we came from the same place, where certain values ran deep: first, loyalty, faith, resolve, service, your word. It was pounded into my head from the time I was child: ""Joey, you're a man. You either have your word—without your word, you're not a man."" And he met the marker for what I always believed was the most important thing which you can measure a person by: their actions and keeping their word.
If Harry said he was going to do something, he did it. He didn't do what the modern-day rationale is: ""When I told you I would do that, I didn't realize that this would happen."" No matter what happened, if he gave you his word, he kept it. You could bank on it.
That's how he got so much done for the good of the country for so many decades. That's how he literally saved—we forget it—Social Security during the Bush years; stopped Yucca Mountain from becoming a nuclear waste site; secured the votes for the Affordable Care Act.
It's how he helped us rein in Wall Street—the excesses—and repealed ""don't ask, don't tell."" It's how he created Nevada's first national park and conserved Lake Tahoe. And how he was always championed Native Americans and Tribal communities and so much more.
None of it was easy. Not a lot of it was particularly popular when he was doing it. That's the thing about Harry: He never gave up. He never gave up. He never gave up on anybody he cared about.
Like every great leader, he led the Democratic Caucus just—not by speaking, but by listening, by hearing all points of view and finding a common ground.
Harry cared so much about his fellow Americans and so little about what anybody thought of him. He was all Searchlight, no spotlight.
I always appreciate the private comfort—and so does Jill, who is with me tonight—that he offered me and Jill in difficult moments in our lives. We know we're not the only ones.
Since his passing, we've all heard those wonderful tributes. The gracious way he would console grieving—the grieving and encourage someone living with a disability. I still have that picture of our buddy Max Baucus [Cleland],* Max losing three of his limbs. He's—Harry is standing in front of him in the wheelchair, holding his cheeks. And you know Max knew—Max knew Harry cared about him.
The generous way he would empower a new colleague or insist that the new moms and dads on his staff would put their family first, even before their jobs, and do it always. And the genuine friendships he made with the Capitol Police have been recognized three times, because he was one of them—he wore the uniform.
To a friend in need, Harry's voice was soft and gentle. In praise of himself, he was stone-cold silent. In the pursuit of fairness and prosperity, his voice would echo and will echo for generations in this State.
Look, let there be no doubt: Harry Reid will be considered one of the greatest Senate Majority Leaders in history. I've served longer than all but about 12 United States Senators—served there for over 36 years. I've had the honor of serving with a few names of those names to be on that shortlist.
For Harry, it wasn't about power; it was about the sake of power, about the power to be able to use power to do right by people. That's why you wanted Harry in your corner, and that's what we should remember as a nation today. Harry knew better than most how difficult democracy is, that the idea of America itself is under attack from dark and deepening forces, that we're in a battle for the soul of America.
Landra, I remember sitting in a room with Harry when he was supporting me for President and my explaining to him the reason I decided to run when I had decided I was never going to do that again was watching all those neo-Nazis come out of the fields down in Virginia, chanting anti-Semitic bile, carrying Nazi flags. And he asked me, ""What?"" I said, ""We have to restore the soul of America.""
No one knew it better than Harry: Protecting democracy requires vigilant stewardship. Harry's life shows that for all—from our darkest days, we can find light and find hope.
Just look at his life: In just about every respect, Harry Reid came into this world with the odds against him. He believed life—and he lived it, and he left it believing anything was possible. He has demonstrated that anything is possible. Look at this incredible family.
Harry, in a small way, reminds me of my dad. My dad used to say, ""Joey, never explain and never complain."" I remember one day we were having an event when I was running for my, I guess, it was fifth term. We were at my house. I was feeling a little sorry for myself, talking about a family—loss of a daughter. My dad said, ""I'll be back in a minute.""
He left the house—we were waiting for people to show up—went up to the local Hallmark store and came back with a cartoon that was a little brass plaque with two sections to it. There were two clips from the cartoon character Hägar the Horrible.
And in one, Hägar the Viking, on his ship, had been moving along near the rocks, lightning comes out of the sky, charged his horns of his helmet, breaks the mast of his ship. And he's looking up at God, and he's going, ""God, why me?"" In the next frame is a picture with Hägar and the ship and a voice coming down from Heaven saying, ""Why not?""
That was my dad: ""What makes you so special these things wouldn't happen to you? Why not? Stand up, get up, never bow, never bend, never yield."" That was Harry. ""Never complain."" That's what I admired so much about him.
Above Harry's desk, as we all know, in his Senate office was a giant portrait of Mark Twain. They both—Harry and Mark Twain—loved Nevada, and they both—they both—knew how to say things we know to be true about ourselves and about our country.
For Harry, it was this, as he said himself—he said, quote, ""I grew up around people of strong values, even if they rarely talked about them."" He went on to say, ""They loved their country, worshipped God, never shunned hard work, and never asked for special favors.""
That's Harry. That's America. Here is someone Mark Twain himself would have written about as a defining character in America's story had he known Harry.
To his staff, known as ""Team Reid,"" you've lost an incredibly genuine role model. But we see you carrying on HMR's legacy. The people of Nevada, you lost a beloved son, but his spirit is always going to burn as bright as the desert sun. To the Nation, we lost a giant of America, a plainspoken, honorable, decent, brave, unyielding man.
May this be his legacy: to call on each of us to be our best, to speak truth from the heart, to take up the remaining rounds of Harry Reid's good fight for the America we all love. What a gift. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. What a gift. What a life of a nation that he turned until his last breath.
Landra, God bless you, God bless the entire family, God bless my friend Harry—a great American—and God protect our troops."
"December 10, 2021",Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Former Senator Robert J. Dole,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-former-senator-robert-j-dole,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Reverend clergy, distinguished guests: Among the many memories from 50 years of friendship, there is one that especially captures what Bob Dole was as a man and, in my view, as a patriot. We were on our way to the 50th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, but we started in Italy, in Anzio. Much has been written about his time in Anzio, but to be there with him felt significantly different.
He was on a mission in the mountains. Nazi gunfire and mortar fire was thick. A man was dying—men were dying. Facing a hail of bullets, Second Lieutenant Robert Joseph Dole hurled a grenade into an empty [enemy]* gun nest.
He was trying to help a fallen comrade, his platoon radioman, when everything changed. And I mean everything changed. His spine was damaged because fire tore across the hills, shattering his body. Grievously wounded, he was paralyzed. Dragged behind a wall, Bob would pass in and out of consciousness, dreaming of home as he lay bleeding in the foxhole for nearly 9 hours. He was 21 years old.
Nearly eight decades on, we gather here in a world far different from the mountainous battlefield in 1949—45. But there's something that connects that past and present, wartime and peace, then and now: the courage, the grit, the goodness, and the grace of Second Lieutenant named Bob Dole, who became Congressman Dole, Senator Dole; a statesman, husband, father, friend, colleague, and a word that's often overused, but not here: a genuine hero—Bob Dole.
Dean, and the clergy officiating today's service; President Clinton; Vice President Harris, Vice President Pence, and Cheney, and Quayle; Speaker Pelosi; Leader Schumer; Leader McConnell; Members of Congress of both parties past and present; members of the Cabinet; General Milley and leaders of our military; distinguished guests; and most of all, the Dole family—Elizabeth.
It's been said that ""memory is the power to gather roses in winter."" Bob left you with 45 years' worth of roses, of a life built and a love shared that's going to guide you through the difficult days ahead. Jill and I will always be there for you, as many others in this church will be, as you and Bob were always there for us in ways nobody knows.
And, Robin, you carry your father's pride, grace, and character. He's always going to be with you, because as the old saying goes—we Irish say—""You are your father's daughter."" You are your father's daughter.""
Bob Dole's story is a very American one. Born and raised in a three-room house through the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Shipped out as a young man to World War II. Wounded in battle on the same weekend that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was being mourned by millions. Bob came home, rebuilt his life, painful hour by painful day by painful week by painful month by painful year. Hearing he and Danny Inouye, who was wounded on a mountain not far from where he was, talk about the recovery they spent together for all those—literally, several—years, it was astounding. God, what courage Bob Dole had.
He then went to school on the GI bill; came to Washington with the New Frontier; bravely voted for civil rights and voting rights in the years of the Kennedys, Lyndon Johnson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Ran for President on the ticket with Gerald Ford.
And through the ages of Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush the elder, and Clinton, Bob was literally the master of the Senate. We served together for 25 years. We disagreed, but we were never disagreeable with one another, not one time that I can think of.
I found Bob to be a man of principle, pragmatism, and enormous integrity. He came into the arena with certain guiding principles that began with devotion to country, to fair play, to decency, to dignity, to honor, to literally attempting to find the common good. That's how he worked with George McGovern to fight hunger in America, particularly as it affected children, and around the world.
He worked with Teddy Kennedy and Tom Harkin to bring down the barriers of Americans living with disabilities, a profound change and a profound act of grace. He worked with Daniel Patrick Moynihan to literally save Social Security, because Bob believed every American deserved to grow old with their basic dignity—basic dignity—intact. And over the opposition of many in his own party and some in mine, he managed the bill that created the Federal holiday in the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. Bob Dole—Bob Dole—did that.
He never forgot where he came from. And I've never forgot what he said to our colleagues about the effort for the King holiday. And I'll quote—he said, ""No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class citizens."" No first-class democracy can treat people like second-class citizens.
Bob didn't hate government. He knew the people who needed him most are the people most in need. He wanted government to work: to work for folks like him who came up the hard way. ""Just give everybody a chance, Joe. Just a chance.""
During the Depression, Bob's parents moved into the basement of their three-room—not three-bedroom—their three-room home in Russell, Kansas, so they could rent out, quote, ""the upstairs."" Bob understood hardship. He had known hardship, and he never forgot it. He never forgot the people, as well, who sent him to Washington, people from Russell and from Kansas.
Bob was a man who always did his duty, who lived by a code of honor. Almost seems strange to say that today, but he lived by a code of honor, and he meant it. Just as his colleagues, Republican and Democrat, looked at him, I think they saw him the same way I did. Just ask any who served with him at the time. Bob Dole fit my dad's description. He said: ""You must be a man of your word. Without your word, you're not a man."" And Bob Dole was a man of his word.
He loved his country, which he served his whole life. The Bible tells us: To whom much is given, much is expected. And Bob Dole, for all his hardship, believed he'd been given the greatest gift of all: He was an American. He was an American. And he felt it.
Let's be honest. Bob Dole was always honest, sometimes to a fault. [ Laughter ] He once endured the wrath of his fellow Republicans when there was a legitimate fight going on to defund Amtrak. Now, I've traveled over 1,200,000 miles on Amtrak because I commuted every single day.
It came time for, literally, the deciding vote—the deciding vote—on whether we're going to defund Amtrak. And he cast the vote against his party, deciding to keep funding Amtrak. And obviously, you might guess, he was asked why. ""Why would you do that?"" [ Laughter ] He said, ""It's the best way to get Joe Biden the hell out of here at night so he's not here in the morning."" [ Laughter ] Excuse my language, but—[ laughter ]—true story. Absolutely true story. God, I loved the guy. As I said, he was always honest.
But Bob relished a good political fight, as much as anybody I've ever served with in the 36 years I was in the Senate. And Bob gave as good or better than he got.
He was a proud Republican. He chaired his party. He led its caucus in the United States Senate. And he bore the banner as its nominee for Vice President and President of the United States. He could be partisan, and that was fine. Americans have been partisan since Jefferson and Hamilton squared off in George Washington's cabinet.
But like them, Bob Dole was a patriot. He was a patriot. And here's what his patriotism teaches us, in my view, as Bob Dole himself wrote at the end of his life—and I quote him—""I cannot pretend that I have not been a loyal champion of my party, but I always served my country best when I did so first and foremost as an American."" End of quote. First and foremost as an American.
That was Bob Dole. Liddy, that was your husband; that was your dad. Always as an American. He understood that we're all part of something much bigger than ourselves—and he really did, I felt; he really understood it—and that ""compromise"" isn't a dirty word, it's the cornerstone of our democracy.
Consensus is required in a democracy to get anything done. That's how you get things done. Again, listen to Bob Dole's words, not mine. I'm quoting him again: ""I learned that it is difficult to get anything done unless you can compromise—not your principles, but your willingness to see the other side. Those who suggest [that] compromise is a sign of weakness misunderstand the fundamental strength of . . . democracy."" End of quote.
In his final days, Bob made it clear that he was deeply concerned about the threat to American democracy, not from foreign nations, but from the division tearing us apart from within. And this soldier reminded us, and I quote, ""Too many of us have sacrificed too much in defending freedom from foreign adversaries to allow our democracy to crumble"" in a state—""under a state of infighting that grows more unacceptable"" day by day. Grows more unacceptable day by day. He wrote this when he knew his days were numbered—in small numbers.
My fellow Americans, taps is now sounding for this soldier of America, forged in war, tested by adversity. Taps is now sounding for this patriot driven by a sense of mission to give back to the land that gave everything to him for which he nearly gave his all. Taps is now sounding for this giant of our time and of all time. We're bidding this great American farewell.
But we know: as long as we keep his spirit alive; as long as we see each other not as enemies, but as neighbors and colleagues; as long as we remember that we're here not to tear down, but to build up; as long as we remember that, then taps will never sound for Bob Dole. For Bob will be with us always, cracking a joke, moving a bill, finding common ground.
In his final message to the Nation, Bob said that whenever he started a new journey—whenever he started a new journey—the first thing he would do, and I quote, is ""sit back and watch for a few days,"" then start standing up for what he thought was right. End of quote.
Bob Dole has taken his final journey. He's sitting back now, watching us. Now it's our job to start standing up for what's right for America. I salute you, my friend. Your Nation salutes you.
And I believe the words of the poet R.G. Ingersoll, when he described heroism, better fit you than anyone I know. And Ingersoll wrote the following: ""When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns to compromise with death, that is heroism.""
May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, Bob. God bless Bob Dole, God bless America, and may God protect our troops."
"November 10, 2021","Eulogy at the Funeral of Former Governor Ruth Ann Minner of Delaware in Milford, Delaware",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-former-governor-ruth-ann-minner-delaware-milford-delaware,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Well, Tommy, you left it to me. [ Laughter ] We all brought our weapons. I brought my rosary. [ Laughter ] I've got a story about that with Ruth Ann.
Folks, to our beloved Delaware, to our beloved nation, and to our beloved family: Here in Milford, in this house of God, we find truth in the old proverb, ""A good example is the best sermon."" To me, that was Ruth Ann. ""A good example is the best sermon.""
Ruth Ann was, without engaging in hyperbole, one of the—Delaware's real, true pioneers, one of the most remarkable and inspirational people I got to meet. I didn't know her—I knew her extremely well, I thought, but not in the same way that the earlier speakers have known her, working with her every single day.
Ruth Ann and I, we'd talk when one of us were in trouble politically or one of—[ laughter ]—or one of us were seeking advice from the other person. I mean that sincerely.
And she was one of the most remarkable, inspirational people that Jill and I have met and that our family has ever known. And we've met a lot of people. We've met a lot of successful women at home and internationally. Ruth Ann had something different than almost everybody I've ever worked with.
Mr. Lindell—Lindale, I should say; Governor Carney; Governor Carper; the Right Reverend Blunt Rochester—[ laughter ]—that girl can preach; Governor Markell; and the Minner family: Look, in Delaware, we know the power of her example, and we know it pretty well. Every one of us in these pews had some interaction with Ruth Ann, beyond the family. But it's one that every American should know—her example. And I mean this sincerely.
Because of the generosity of the people of Delaware, I had an opportunity to meet virtually every serious, well-known person in the world that—because of the nature of my job. And I'd not often, but occasionally, talk about Ruth Ann when they'd ask me about, ""Can you tell me about—can you define America for me?"" Not a joke. And I'd talk about—it's just about opportunity. And it's about being able to dream something beyond your circumstance and have some shot being able to get there.
But it's not just learning that she was elected to the House of Delaware—it's not just learning about that—or that she went to the Delaware Senate, Lieutenant Governor, or as the first woman Governor. But it's how she got there, which I think, Nance, is what it's all about, how she did it.
It's how each time she climbed up the political ladder, she always stayed grounded in the lives of everyday people—whether it was the folks at the corner store, whether it was her neighbors, whether it was her family. Just ordinary people—that's what she and I—when we'd talk, we'd talk about.
I remember when I did the Inaugural. I said, ""This is about just—never once, when we've given the American people a shot—just a shot—never one single time has the American people—ordinary people—ever, ever let us down.""
[ At this point, a cell phone rang .]
That's okay. That's—[ laughter ]. That's Ruth Ann saying, ""Keep going, Joe."" [ Laughter ]
But you know, the thing is, Ruth Ann had that—that ""something special"" my mom would talk about, in that she had a sense of empathy. She understood. She understood. When she looked at you and talked to you, especially if it was a crisis, you knew she understood.
You know, and the American people should know that she was a Governor who once, as a teenager, dropped out of school to—you all know it, but the American people should know it—dropped out of school to help run the family farm. It sounds like fairy-tale stuff, but it's real. It happened.
As a young widow who, after Frank suddenly passed away, decided that she's going to get her GED while working two jobs and raising three boys—easy to read, hard as the devil to do.
An entrepreneur who helped build a successful auto-towing company that the boys ran. A pathbreaker who—I remember this one, because I was doing the same thing with less efficiency as a member of the banking committee—which was when she went to get that loan and needed a signature of her husband. She and I talked about this. She needed—she couldn't get it because her husband needed to sign it.
And after going out to the elected officials and saying, ""Can we do something about this?"" she decided the best way was to change the law, was to write it herself. She determined to do it, and she did it. Not a lot of highfalutin speeches or anything, she just did it.
And you know, no wonder she was such a tireless champion of education in Delaware—for a better education for every Delawarean. Ruth Ann was a student at Del Tech, where after—before my wife, Jill, taught there for years and years. The reason Jill is not with me today is, she's teaching today, fulltime as a professor at Northern Virginia Community College.
Ruth Ann was a student there—Del Tech. Just as smart and as talented as anyone else that was there, but just looking for a chance to get ahead. Not asking for anything, just a shot. ""Let me get a credential. Just give me a shot.""
No wonder she was a tireless champion in protecting Delaware's public lands and waters. It sounds corny, but she was a farmer's daughter. She understood it. She understood the consequence.
One of the few times—I say to the Governors here—that she called me about working with Harkins from Iowa to make sure we put away a lot of land—one of the reasons why. And I called her when—we're going to lay aside more land for farmers—and they get paid for doing it—than any time in American history if my bills go through. That's Ruth Ann. It's about the next generation, not just this one. She never talked about it that way. She just talked about it like this was the right thing to do.
You know, having watched Roger pass from cancer caused her to lead the effort to create the Delaware Cancer Consortium to increase screening, lower incidence rates of cancer, help end—as Jill and I talk about—ending cancer as we know it. When Jill started the breast cancer initiative—things have changed a long time ago—and Ruth Ann was one of the first people to call her.
Tommy, when I raised breast health—cancer—and breast health and cancer initiatives in the United States Senate, Bob Byrd showed me, under the Senate rules, I wasn't able to use the word ""breast"" on the floor the United States Senate. Not a joke. Not a joke. How much has changed because of Ruth Ann, because of the tireless, incredibly large number of mostly women that she encouraged?
You know, it's no wonder she was so unwavering on questions of principle, because that's what drove her. And as was stated by the Gov, Ruth Ann understood the—an elected office is about what you're willing to lose over, not what you're willing to do when you win.
When I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the Senate—beating Caleb Boggs, a really fine man who endorsed me when I ran the second time—the thing I—people would come up to me and say, ""Well, what's the secret?"" Because if I won—this kid—this Irish Catholic kid from Claymont, Delaware, who didn't have the proverbial pot—how could this happen? There had to be a secret. They'd literally ask me, ""What's the secret?""
The secret is represented by the women and men who have spoken already. ""What are you willing to lose over?"" If you haven't figured that out, you should never run for office. Go into another enterprise. You'd make a lot more money, and you get a lot less heat. [ Laughter ] No, I'm serious. What difference does it make if you're not doing what you believe?
So, you know—and I, like all of you, remember when she decided that protecting the health of Delawareans from cigarette smoke at a time when opponents would chant, ""Ban Ruth Ann."" Remember that? ""Ban Ruth Ann. Ban Ruth Ann."" Remember what she'd say? I remember. She would say, ""Why should the life and health of a restaurant worker be valued less than anybody else's?"" Because I believe that's how she thought about it.
What made her so powerful: She expressed what she really thought and felt. Didn't have to be clothed—cloaked in poetic language, just what she thought. Everybody understood what she meant. She worried about that waitress who was making 5 bucks an hour, busting her neck, breathing in that smoke. That's who she cared about, and people knew it.
You know, like many people here, I can honestly say that, but for the love of my family and the grace of God, I wouldn't be here today without Ruth Ann's support. She was always there for me, for us, for my beloved Beau. I think she cared about him, guys. I think she really cared about him.
Beau was elected attorney general when Ruth Ann was Governor. And the thing that surprised her most was she was ready to appoint him attorney general—[ laughter ]—and he wouldn't do it. He had too much of Ruth Ann in him. [ Laughter ]
But no kidding. You remember that? He wouldn't do it. He said, ""I'm going to run for it."" He couldn't have asked for a better angel to have on his shoulder than Ruth Ann. He respected her, he looked up to her, and I think she respected him. Like Ruth Ann, Beau walked among the people. When we lost him, Ruth Ann understood.
The Minner family knows how, when you have serious loss, people go up and say, ""I know how you feel."" And you know they mean well. But after a while, especially if you're well known, you feel like saying, ""You have no damn idea how I feel."" You know they mean well.
When someone comes up, like Ruth Ann, who's has lost two husbands, lost a son, and said, ""Joe, I know how you feel,"" you know she knows. And just seeing her continue to walk, continue to speak out, continue to embrace the family that's left, you think to yourself, ""Maybe I can do that.""
Many of you have had significant loss. You know, when it happens, you feel like there's a black hole in your chest, you're being sucked into it. But there's certain people who come along; just by talking to you, they kind of reach down and keep you from sinking. Ruth Ann was one of those people that helped a lot, particularly for Jill.
You know, to America, let her be remembered as a leader who understood that democracy was a lot more than a form of government. Democracy is a way of being. It begins and grows in an open heart and with a willingness to come together by searching to find a common cause—not always the same exact answer, but a common cause. If you get to that point, there's nothing we can't solve if you acknowledge the common cause. And your grandmom and your great-grandmom knew how to do that. She reached out.
And you know, empathy is the fuel of democracy. I've learned, over time, it's the single most—how can I—underappreciated aspect of what makes governments work when they work. It's that sense of empathy, that thing that just says—you have a leader who says, ""That person knows what I'm going through.""
I was being reminded by my son Hunter, when I was trying to get the COP26—what's going on over in Europe on the environment—together, it makes a lot of difference. All empathy is looking at you and understanding what you're worried about. And you know and I know what you're worried about.
You know, one of my favorite quotes—I used to stutter badly when I was a kid. And I had a book of Emerson's—Ralph Waldo Emerson's saying on my—on the bureau with—I shared in a three-bedroom, split-level house—it was a decent place—with my two brothers—three brothers and—two brothers and I, and then a third brother came along.
But I used to get up in the middle of the night, and I'd—when everybody was asleep—and get a flashlight out. And I'd try to learn how to speak without—without—just—without making a fool of myself. And I'd shine it on the bottom of the mirror in this room we had where the four of us slept. And what would happen is that I'd try to keep my face from getting contorted when a stutter—go, go—and you just feel foolish.
And one of the things that I remember is—one of Emerson's quotes was, ""Society is [like] a wave. The wave moves"" on, but the particles remain the same. Meaning, God ain't made a new brand of man or woman in millennia or a lot longer.
And Ruth Ann kind of understood that. Whether she'd say it that way or not, I don't know. She understood that human beings are human beings. And you know—and she understood, I think, what a lot of us forget and, as President of the United States of America, I try to remind myself almost every day: Government is about making sure the system works—it functions, it works for people, you can deliver something to them.
Ruth Ann's love for the people of Delaware was really extraordinary, and we loved her back here in Delaware. She knew that while we have never made real the full promise of America for all Americans, every single generation has just kicked the clock up just a little bit closer. We've made slow, but consistent progress, opened a little wider.
And it's like the phrase used that she was more progressive than everybody thought, even though she would never think of herself as progressive. But the progressive part is: Society is like a wave. The wave moves on. The particles, the people don't change.
You know, the mission she now leaves us as a way forward is that's the power of Ruth Ann's example. If all of America—this is—if I were back teaching, I'd teach a course in Ruth Ann Minner. [ Laughter ] Seriously. Think about it. Think of what she did. A bright woman from humble circumstances. No fanfare. Not a whole lot of hollering and shouting. Just got up every morning and put one foot in front of the other.
Tommy knows—knew my dad. My dad would say just one thing: ""If you get knocked down, get up. Just get up. Get up."" His other expression was, ""Never complain and never explain.""
Well, you know, from our history, there's hope for the future—from solace, to strength. From our hearts, we continue to work for democracy. This was Ruth Ann's and my view—how she viewed things. Work of our time—of all time—and the life of Ruth Ann Minner: ""Just keep moving forward. Don't stop. Don't quit.""
To all of you who have worked alongside her, I want to thank you for your service and carrying on her legacy. And to her family—to Frank and Margaret, and Wayne and Phyllis, and Cindy and in Gary's memory, and to all of the grandchildren and children: The Bible teaches, as was referenced earlier, ""Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.""
While comfort can be a long time in coming, if you have faith, I promise you—and hold onto one another—it will come, and it will give you a purpose in Ruth Ann's memory. For real.
There's an anthem that means a lot to the Bidens that I quoted in my Inaugural Address—and, I might add, on election night, when it was unusual, because we didn't get to have one of those big events, et cetera—it was down at the Riverfront—I walked out on that stage to accept the win. And who was the first person I saw—[ laughter ]—in an automobile in front of me, standing on a car? Ruth Ann Minner.
Just like when I decided to run for the Senate. I came down—well, I was told—in 1972, this kid from Delaware had been a public defender, a civil rights guy. And I was coming down to Milford. I thought, ""I'm in hostile territory, man."" [ Laughter ]
My politics wasn't what everybody expected. But your mom greeted me. Your mom went out and talked about me. Your mom brought the family and her friends together. That's when I figured out: All I need in Milford is Ruth Ann. [ Laughter ]
But you know, this anthem is one that I don't think she knew, but one that is—means a lot in my family that I used in my Inaugural Address for being sworn in as President. It goes like this. It's called the ""American Anthem."" It says:
The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day.
What shall our legacy be? What will our children say?
Let me know in my heart that when my days are through
America, America, I did my best for you.
Ruth Ann gave her best to Delaware. She gave her best to America. May God bless you, dear friend. May God bless America and Ruth Ann Minner.
Thank you."
"June 23, 2021",Remarks at the Funeral Ceremony for Former Senator John W. Warner III,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-ceremony-for-former-senator-john-w-warner-iii,"Joseph R. Biden, Jr.",eulogy,"Reverend Hollerith; distinguished clergy; Members of the Congress and our military; distinguished guests, Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, and Andrew, and the Warner family: It's a great honor to be invited to speak a few moments about John.
A few days after John's passing, I visited Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day—a sacred place on a solemn day when we undertake the fundamental act of remembrance. And amid the moments that I was there and the monuments of stone, we remember each marker represented a precious life. We remember the heroes of the greatest generation the world has ever known and that bears a noble name—the United States of America—the only nation founded on an idea that we're all created equal, ""endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights,"" including, ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""; and a democracy that is the very soul of our Nation and that must be defended at all costs, a soul embodied by all those patriots buried in Arlington and the fields across the world and by our dear friend, John Warner.
Like many here, I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate. While we represented different political parties, I can say without hesitation John was a man of conscience, character, and honor, with a deep commitment to God and country.
Enlisted in the Navy—in the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War II. A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea. Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon, then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense; the second longest serving Senator from Virginia and the longest serving Republican.
A member of the Greatest Generation, and as that, he understood that democracy is more than a form of government; democracy is a way of being. He understood it begins and grows in an open heart and with the willingness to work across the aisle and come together in common cause.
And that empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies. Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree. From John's perspective, especially when we disagreed. That's how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people. I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace. John opposing torture and ending gun violence; on protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
John's decisions were always guided by his values, by his convictions, and never by personal political consequences. And he was always guided by his obligation to all those he represented, even those who did not vote for him.
Every Senator wears the pride of his or her State on their sleeve, but John's love for the people of Virginia was something special. And they loved him back and kept reelecting him because they knew John understood the job of Senator was bigger than himself. It was about more than just John.
And as we say in the Senate, ""Excuse me a point of personal privilege"": When John endorsed me for President last year, it carried an extra meaning for me. The Senators and Congresspersons here will understand this. It wasn't merely that a prominent Republican endorsed me; when John endorsed me, it gave me confidence, not about winning, about being able to do the job. John gave me confidence.
You know, in the battle for the soul of America today, John Warner is a reminder of what we can do when we come together as one Nation. While we've never made real the full promise of America to all Americans, John's life is a reminder that every generation—every generation—has opened the door of opportunity a little bit wider. Every one.
And the mission handed down generation to generation is the work of perfecting the Union, a mission he now leaves us with a way forward. That's the power of remembrance. It lies not just in our history, but in our hope for the future. Not just in our solace, but in our strength. It lies in our hearts to continue the work of democracy—the work of our time, of all time, and the work of John's whole life.
To John's Senate staff: Thank you for your service and for all you'll do to carry on John's legacy. And to his family—Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, Andrew—Jill [and]* I know it hurts to remember. Sometimes, it just hurts to remember. But it's also the way to heal, to remember.
The Bible teaches, ""Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."" While comfort can be a long time in coming, I promise you it will come. It will give you purpose in his memory, in his love for you, in his love for this country.
Virginia, I know you'll be reciting your father's favorite poem, a sort of an anthem. Here's another one that describes him so well, in my view, that means a great deal to my family and to me. It's called ""American Anthem"":
The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day,
What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?
Let me know in my heart when my days are through,
America, America, I gave my best to you.
John Warner gave his best to America and, to the best of my knowledge, to everybody he had a relationship with. May God bless him. He was a good man, a great American. It was an honor to have known him and worked with him."
"September 30, 2016",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former President Shimon Peres of Israel in Jerusalem,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-former-president-shimon-peres-israel-jerusalem,Barack Obama,eulogy,"Tzvia, Yoni, Chemi, and generations of the Peres family; President Rivlin; Prime Minister Netanyahu; members of the Israeli Government and the Knesset; heads of state and government; and guests from around the world, including President Abbas, whose presence here is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace; to the people of Israel: I could not be more honored to be in Jerusalem to say farewell to my friend Shimon Peres, who showed us that justice and hope are at the heart of the Zionist idea.
A free life, in a homeland regained. A secure life, in a nation that can defend itself, by itself. A full life, in friendship with nations who can be counted on as allies, always. A bountiful life, driven by the simple pleasures of family and by big dreams. This was Shimon Peres's life. This is the State of Israel. This is the story of the Jewish people over the last century, and it was made possible by a founding generation that counts Shimon as one of its own.
Shimon once said that, ""The message of the Jewish people to mankind is that faith and moral vision can triumph over all adversity."" For Shimon, that moral vision was rooted in an honest reckoning of the world as it is. Born in the shtetl, he said he felt ""surrounded by a sea of thick and threatening forests."" When his family got the chance to go to Palestine, his beloved grandfather's parting words were simple: ""Shimon, stay a Jew."" Propelled with that faith, he found his home. He found his purpose. He found his life's work. But he was still a teenager when his grandfather was burned alive by the Nazis in the town where Shimon was born. The synagogue in which he prayed became an inferno. The railroad tracks that had carried him toward the Promised Land also delivered so many of his people to death camps.
And so from an early age, Shimon bore witness to the cruelty that human beings could inflict on each other, the ways that one group of people could dehumanize another; the particular madness of anti-Semitism, which has run like a stain through history. That understanding of man's ever-present sinfulness would steel him against hardship and make him vigilant against threats to Jewry around the world.
But that understanding would never harden his heart. It would never extinguish his faith. Instead, it broadened his moral imagination, and gave him the capacity to see all people as deserving of dignity and respect. It helped him see not just the world as it is, but the world as it should be.
What Shimon did to shape the story of Israel is well chronicled. Starting on the kibbutz he founded with his love Sonya, he began the work of building a model community. Ben-Gurion called him to serve the Haganah at headquarters to make sure that the Jewish people had the armaments and the organization to secure their freedom. After independence, surrounded by enemies who denied Israel's existence and sought to drive it into the sea, the child who had wanted to be a ""poet of stars"" became a man who built Israel's defense industry, who laid the foundation for the formidable armed forces that won Israel's wars. His skill secured Israel's strategic position. His boldness sent Israeli commandos to Entebbe and rescued Jews from Ethiopia. His statesmanship built an unbreakable bond with the United States of America and so many other countries. His contributions didn't end there. Shimon also showed what people can do when they harness reason and science to a common cause. He understood that a country without many natural resources could more than make up for it with the talents of its people. He made hard choices to roll back inflation and climb out from a terrible economic crisis. He championed the promise of science and technology to make the desert bloom and turned this tiny country into a central hub of the digital age, making life better not just for people here, but for people around the world.
Indeed, Shimon's contribution to this nation is so fundamental, so pervasive, that perhaps sometimes they can be overlooked. For a younger generation, Shimon was probably remembered more for a peace process that never reached its endpoint. They would listen to critics on the left who might argue that Shimon did not fully acknowledge the failings of his nation or perhaps more numerous critics on the right who argued that he refused to see the true wickedness of the world, and called him naive.
But whatever he shared with his family or his closest friends, to the world he brushed off the critics. And I know from my conversations with him that his pursuit of peace was never naive. Every Yom HaShoah, he read the names of the family that he lost. As a young man, he had fed his village by working in the fields during the day, but then defending it by carrying a rifle at night. He understood, in this war-torn region, where too often Arab youth are taught to hate Israel from an early age, he understood just how hard peace would be. I'm sure he was alternatively angry and bemused to hear the same critics, who called him hopelessly naive, depend on the defense architecture that he himself had helped to build.
I don't believe he was naive. But he understood from hard-earned experience that true security comes through making peace with your neighbors. ""We won them all,"" he said of Israel's wars. ""But we did not win the greatest victory that we aspired to: release from the need to win victories.""
And just as he understood the practical necessity of peace, Shimon believed that Israel's exceptionalism was rooted not only in fidelity to the Jewish people, but to the moral and ethical vision, the precepts of his Jewish faith. ""The Jewish people weren't born to rule another people,"" he would say. ""From the very first day we are against slaves and masters.""
Out of the hardships of the diaspora, he found room in his heart for others who suffered. He came to hate prejudice with the passion of one who knows how it feels to be its target. Even in the face of terrorist attacks, even after repeated disappointments at the negotiation table, he insisted that as human beings, Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews, and must therefore be equal in self-determination. Because of his sense of justice, his analysis of Israel's security, his understanding of Israel's meaning, he believed that the Zionist idea would be best protected when Palestinians, too, had a state of their own.
Of course, we gather here in the knowledge that Shimon never saw his dream of peace fulfilled. The region is going through a chaotic time. Threats are ever present. And yet he did not stop dreaming, and he did not stop working. By the time that I came to work with Shimon, he was in the twilight of his years, although he might not admit it. I would be the 10th U.S. President since John F. Kennedy to sit down with Shimon; the 10th to fall prey to his charms. I think of him sitting in the Oval Office, this final member of Israel's founding generation, under the portrait of George Washington, telling me stories from the past, but more often talking with enthusiasm of the present: his most recent lecture, his next project, his plans for the future, the wonders of his grandchildren. In many ways, he reminded me of some other giants of the 20th century that I've had the honor to meet—men like Nelson Mandela; women like Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth—leaders who have seen so much, whose lives span such momentous epochs, that they find no need to posture or traffic in what's popular in the moment; people who speak with depth and knowledge, not in sound bites. They find no interest in polls or fads.
And like these leaders, Shimon could be true to his convictions even if they cut against the grain of current opinion. He knew, better than the cynic, that if you look out over the arc of history, human beings should be filled not with fear but with hope. I'm sure that's why he was so excited about technology because for him, it symbolized the march of human progress. And it's why he loved so much to talk about young people, because he saw young people unburdened by the prejudices of the past. It's why he believed in miracles because in Israel, he saw a miracle come true.
As Americans and Israelis, we often talk about the unbreakable bonds between our nations. And, yes, these bonds encompass common interests—vital cooperation that makes both our nations more secure. But today, we are reminded that the bonds which matter most run deeper. Anchored in a Judeo-Christian tradition, we believe in the irreducible value of every human being. Our nations were built on that idea. They were built in large part by stubborn idealists and striving immigrants, including those who had fled war and fled oppression. Both our nations have flaws that we have not always fixed, corners of our history which date back to our founding that we do not always squarely address. But because our founders planted not just flags in the eternal soil, but also planted the seeds of democracy, we have the ability to always pursue a better world. We have the capacity to do what is right.
As an American, as a Christian, a person partly of African descent, born in Hawaii—a place that could not be further than where Shimon spent his youth—I took great pleasure in my friendship with this older, wiser man. We shared a love of words and books and history. And perhaps, like most politicians, we shared too great a joy in hearing ourselves talk. [ Laughter ] But beyond that, I think our friendship was rooted in the fact that I could somehow see myself in his story, and maybe he could see himself in mine. Because for all of our differences, both of us had lived such unlikely lives. It was so surprising to see the two of us where we had started, talking together in the White House, meeting here in Israel. And I think both of us understood that we were here only because in some way we reflected the magnificent story of our nations.
Shimon's story, the story of Israel, the experience of the Jewish people, I believe it is universal. It's the story of a people who, over so many centuries in the wilderness, never gave up on that basic human longing to return home. It's the story of a people who suffered the boot of oppression and the shutting of the gas chamber's door, and yet never gave up on a belief in goodness. And it's the story of a man who was counted on, and then often counted out, again and again, and who never lost hope.
Shimon Peres reminds us that the State of Israel, like the United States of America, was not built by cynics. We exist because people before us refused to be constrained by the past or the difficulties of the present. And Shimon Peres was never cynical. It is that faith, that optimism, that belief—even when all the evidence is to the contrary—that tomorrow can be better, that makes us not just honor Shimon Peres, but love him.
The last of the founding generation is now gone. Shimon accomplished enough things in his life for a thousand men. But he understood that it is better to live to the very end of his time on Earth with a longing not for the past, but for the dreams that have not yet come true: an Israel that is secure in a just and lasting peace with its neighbors. And so now this work is in the hand of Israel's next generation, in the hands of Israel's next generation and its friends.
Like Joshua, we feel the weight of responsibility that Shimon seemed to wear so lightly. But we draw strength from his example and the fact that he believed in us, even when we doubted ourselves.
Scripture tells us that before his death, Moses said, ""I call upon heaven and earth to bear witness this day that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live.""
Uvacharta Bachayim . Choose life. For Shimon, let us choose life, as he always did. Let us make his work our own. May God bless his memory. And may God bless this country, and this world, that he loved so dearly.
Shimon: Todah Rabah Chaver Yakar ."
"June 07, 2016",Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Former Deputy White House Counsel Cassandra Q. Butts,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-former-deputy-white-house-counsel-cassandra-q-butts,Barack Obama,eulogy,"The President. Good evening.
Audience members. Good evening.
The President. We are here to celebrate the life of our dear friend Cassandra, a warrior for social justice, a warm and generous servant who devoted her life to bettering the lives of others, and an unbelievable friend.
I first met Cassandra in a place that tends to stoke one's passions for social and economic justice: the financial aid line at law school. [ Laughter ] We were just entering Harvard Law. We happened to be next to each other in line, I think it was in Pound Hall, and we were furiously filling out our financial aid forms. I have no doubt I was doing something wrong. She may have looked over my shoulder and said, ""I think that's wrong."" [ Laughter ] And we were inching forward each time the registrar shouted, ""Next!"" We introduced ourselves to each other, and we bonded over the fact that we were signing our lives away to Harvard, fully aware of how long it would take us to pay off that debt that we were about to accrue.
And then, we bonded over other things. We bonded over our love for jazz. We bonded over our fandom of Michael Jordan, because she was a Tar Heel and I was a Bull. We talked about our early beginnings in civic engagement, protesting apartheid, her at North Carolina and me at Occidental. And we talked about our interest in the law, why we were there: the notion that we might somehow take this knowledge that we were going to extract from this place an apply it to help those on society's margins to improve their circumstances.
I made a lot of great friends at Harvard. Some of them are here today, like Judge Wilkins, who was older and cooler than I was at the time and still is. [ Laughter ] I don't know about older, but maybe still cooler. But Cassandra I relied on. I relied on her for counsel and for encouragement. I have a confession to make: I still possess some albums of hers. [ Laughter ] I think there's a Miles Davis album, a John Coltrane album. I've been listening to some of that music since she passed. In my defense, she kept one of my constitutional law books. [ Laughter ] But I think I got the better end of that trade. [ Laughter ]
And that was true generally with Cassandra. Those who knew her, I think, understood that somehow, we were getting the better end of that trade.
In law school, we'd sit around and dream about how we were going to take what we learned in those halls and we'd go change the world. And while we separated for a time after graduation—her coming to Washington, me heading back to Chicago—we stayed in touch. I kept up with her while she was working in Congress and at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. I talked to her about the work I was doing as a civil rights attorney and a professor, and I told her about Michelle and all the hopes and dreams that we had together. And in a lot of ways, she served as a moral compass for me. She was a constant, steady presence.
And when I arrived here in Washington after winning my Senate race, I was 99th in seniority. But I did have a secret weapon, and that was, I knew Cassandra. [ Laughter ] So I asked her for some advice, and she, of course, went farther than that, helping me to hire a smart, dedicated team, helping me to get a conversation going with Pete Rouse, who had been the chief of staff for Tom Daschle and who had no reason to want to deal with somebody who was 99th in seniority. But somehow, she persuaded him to take a meeting with me, and as a consequence, we were able to put together this remarkable team of people, many of whom still work with me today.
She helped me to plan what I might accomplish on behalf of the people of Illinois. And then, because I thought that she didn't have enough to do, I'd send her early chapters of a book I was writing at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning just to see what she thought. And we'd try to have dinner at least once a month, just to keep each other grounded, mainly for her to keep me grounded, because she didn't need help on that front.
I didn't know then that I'd run for President just a few short years later. But when I did, I knew that I needed her help. She was one of my most valuable utility players. She was like a Swiss Army knife: Whatever you needed, you could find. Smart enough to do just about any project, thoughtful enough to help others step in, finding those who might add to our collective efforts.
She was essential in the first days of my administration. Working with Greg Craig and others, she helped to stock our Justice Department with bright, dedicated attorneys. She meticulously crafted our earliest policies so that all who work in the White House hold ourselves to the highest of ethical standards as keepers of the public trust.
In fact, my first Executive orders, which she helped design, reflected both of our views that public service is a privilege, that it's not about advancing yourself or your friends or your clients or your donors or some ideological agenda, it's about advancing the interests of every single American: the pay freeze for senior staff, which made us very popular; the toughest lobbying ban in history; an ethics briefing on what's required of all of us to make sure that we're putting the people's interests above our own, a briefing, by the way, that I was the first person to receive. Each of those policies bore her touch.
And later, as my Deputy Counsel, Cassandra helped to oversee a range of areas, among them the vetting and selection of judicial nominees. And she did that pretty good, because she got one of the finest judges to agree to undergo a difficult process and become an outstanding Supreme Court justice.
But her most lasting impact, at least in my administration, was just being who she was.
Every senior White House appointee in those first days—every single one—had to meet personally with Cassandra. Every single one. That's how much trust I had in her, in her integrity, in her judgment, in her feel for people. She was the person I trusted to ensure that everybody we hired understood the values of this administration and approached their jobs with the kind of professionalism and decency and integrity expected of anyone fortunate enough to serve their country at the highest level.
She knew I wanted the best and the brightest, people with the same kind of high-minded idealism that she and I had talked about late into the night all those years before in law school, what we had imagined might be possible: that politics and government could be different; that this country could be better; that justice could be served, that it wasn't a pipe dream, that it wasn't something in the past, that it was something that could actually be achieved.
What better person to impart that message than Cassandra. What better person to impart upon each of us the notion that there's something bigger than ourselves and that when you give to others and you serve others and you do right by others, that that's what fills you up, that's what makes your life count.
Cassandra was one of those rare people you never wanted to disappoint, not because she was judgmental; she, in fact, was infinitely patient and forgiving of people's foibles. And she used that big, wonderful, deep laugh of hers to make you feel like, yes, everybody is going to make mistakes and everybody is going to screw up. So it wasn't because she was judgmental, it was because you felt somehow that she knew your best self, the person you couldn't always claim to be, but the person you hoped to be. She saw that in you. And I know she made me better, and I believe she made us better.
And if you've spoken to anybody who knew her well over these past several days or any of the innumerable people that she took the time to mentor, you'll hear the same qualities that we were looking for in those early days of the administration applied to her in spades: professionalism, decency, integrity, insight, smarts, humor, and a fundamental kindness. She was a kind person. You know, it's interesting, as you get older, it turns out, kindness counts for a lot.
It's been brought to my attention that, in her final months, Cassandra was working on a passion project: not fine-tuning the sports cars she loved to drive—[ laughter ]—but rather, funding scholarships for underprivileged high school kids who want to go to college to study the arts. And that came as no surprise. That's the kind of thing she'd do.
As a society, we have an unfortunate tendency to celebrate the people we love only once they are gone. So it is a testament to Cassandra, to the life that she lived and shared with us, that so many people celebrated her while she was still here. I do wish I had seen her more this past year. I know she would forgive me and smile and comfort me and tell me not to feel too guilty. Because that's who she was.
And I'd like to close my remarks on that note, by paraphrasing something that's stayed with me from a piece I read about her last week. It concluded by saying that Cassandra is survived by her mother, who lives in North Carolina; by her father, who lives in New York; by her sister, her brother-in-law, and her nephews, who she was so proud of, who live in Maryland; and her friends, who live everywhere. Her friends who live everywhere. How true that is.
She was my friend. She was as true a person as I ever met. I loved her dearly, and I will miss her badly.
We pray that the Lord grants our sister, Cassandra, eternal peace. May He bless her memory. May He bless her family and the lives of everyone that she touched."

Pinckney of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-pastor-clementa-c-pinckney-the-emanuel-african-methodist,Barack Obama,eulogy,"The President. Giving all praise and honor to God.
The Bible calls us to hope. To persevere and have faith in things not seen. ""They were still living by faith when they died,"" Scripture tells us. ""They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on Earth.""
We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith. A man who believed in things not seen. A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. A man of service who persevered, knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would deliver a better life for those who followed.
To Jennifer, his beloved wife; to Eliana and Malana, his beautiful, wonderful daughters; to the Mother Emanuel family, the people of Charleston, the people of South Carolina: I cannot claim to have had the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well. But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina, back when we were both a little bit younger. [ Laughter ] Back when I didn't have visible gray hair. [ Laughter ] And the first thing I noticed was his graciousness, his smile, his reassuring baritone, his deceptive sense of humor, all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation.
Friends of his remarked this week that when Clementa Pinckney entered a room, it was like the future arrived; that even from a young age, folks knew he was special, anointed. He was the progeny of a long line of the faithful, a family of preachers who spread God's word, a family of protesters who sowed change to expand voting rights and desegregate the South. Clem heard their instruction, and he did not forsake their teaching.
He was in the pulpit by 13, pastor by 18, public servant by 23. He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth, nor youth's insecurities. Instead, he set an example worthy of his position, wise beyond his years, in his speech, in his conduct, in his love, faith, and purity.
As a senator, he represented a sprawling swath of the Lowcountry, a place that has long been one of the most neglected in America, a place still wracked by poverty and inadequate schools, a place where children can still go hungry and the sick can go without treatment—a place that needed somebody like Clem.
His position in the minority party meant the odds of winning more resources for his constituents were often long. His calls for greater equity were too often unheeded, the votes he casts were sometimes lonely. But he never gave up. He stayed true to his convictions. He would not grow discouraged. After a full day at the capitol, he'd climb into his car and head to the church to draw sustenance from his family, from his ministry, from the community that loved and needed him. There he would fortify his faith and imagine what might be.
Reverend Pinckney embodied a politics that was neither mean, nor small. He conducted himself quietly and kindly and diligently. He encouraged progress not by pushing his ideas alone, but by seeking out your ideas, partnering with you to make things happen. He was full of empathy and fellow feeling, able to walk in somebody else's shoes and see through their eyes. No wonder one of his senate colleagues remembered Senator Pinckney as ""the most gentle of the 46 of us, the best of the 46 of us.""
Clem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant. But the person who asked probably didn't know the history of the AME church. As our brothers and sisters in the AME church know, we don't make those distinctions. ""Our calling,"" Clem once said, ""is not just within the walls of the congregation, but . . . the life and community in which our congregation resides.""
He embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words; that the ""sweet hour of prayer"" actually lasts the whole week long; that to put our faith in action is more than individual salvation, it's about our collective salvation; that to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and house the homeless is not just a call for isolated charity, but the imperative of a just society.
What a good man. Sometimes, I think that's the best thing to hope for when you're eulogized: after all the words and recitations and résumés are read, to just say someone was a good man.
You don't have to be of high station to be a good man. Preacher by 13. Pastor by 18. Public servant by 23. What a life Clementa Pinckney lived. What an example he set. What a model for his faith. And then, to lose him at 41, slain in his sanctuary with eight wonderful members of his flock, each at different stages in life, but bound together by a common commitment to God.
Cynthia Hurd. Susie Jackson. Ethel Lance. DePayne Middleton-Doctor. Tywanza Sanders. Daniel L. Simmons. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton. Myra Thompson. Good people, decent people, God-fearing people. People so full of life and so full of kindness. People who ran the race, who persevered. People of great faith.
To the families of the fallen, the Nation shares in your grief. Our pain cuts that much deeper because it happened in a church. The church is and always has been the center of African American life, a place to call our own in a too often hostile world, a sanctuary from so many hardships.
Over the course of centuries, Black churches served as ""hush harbors"" where slaves could worship in safety; praise houses where their free descendants could gather and shout, ""Hallelujah""; rest stops for the weary along the Underground Railroad; bunkers for the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement. They have been and continue to be community centers where we organize for jobs and justice, places of scholarship and network, places where children are loved and fed and kept out of harm's way and told that they are beautiful and smart and taught that they matter. That's what happens in church.
That's what the Black church means. Our beating heart. The place where our dignity as a people is inviolate. And there's no better example of this tradition than Mother Emanuel, a church built by Blacks seeking liberty, burned to the ground because its founder sought to end slavery, only to rise up again, a Phoenix from these ashes.
When there were laws banning all-Black church gatherings, services happened here anyway, in defiance of unjust laws. When there was a righteous movement to dismantle Jim Crow, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., preached from its pulpit and marches began from its steps. A sacred place, this church. Not just for Blacks, not just for Christians, but for every American who cares about the steady expansion of human rights and human dignity in this country, a foundation stone for liberty and justice for all. That's what the church meant.
We do not know whether the killer of Reverend Pinckney and eight others knew all of this history. But he surely sensed the meaning of his violent act. It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches, not random, but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress; an act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination, violence and suspicion; an act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our Nation's original sin.
Oh, but God works in mysterious ways. God has different ideas.
He didn't know he was being used by God. Blinded by hatred, the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group, the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle. The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court, in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness. He couldn't imagine that.
The alleged killer could not imagine how the city of Charleston, under the good and wise leadership of Mayor Riley, how the State of South Carolina, how the United States of America would respond: not merely with revulsion at his evil act, but with big-hearted generosity and, more importantly, with a thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life.
Blinded by hatred, he failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood: the power of God's grace. This whole week, I've been reflecting on this idea of grace: the grace of the families who lost loved ones; the grace that Reverend Pinckney would preach about in his sermons; the grace described in one of my favorite hymnals, the one we all know:
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now I'm found; was blind but now I see.
According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It's not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. Grace.
As a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us, for he has allowed us to see where we've been blind. He has given us the chance, where we've been lost, to find our best selves. We may not have earned it, this grace, with our rancor and complacency and short-sightedness and fear of each other, but we got it all the same. He gave it to us anyway. He's once more given us grace. But it is up to us now to make the most of it, to receive it with gratitude and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift.
For too long, we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens. It's true, a flag did not cause these murders. But as people from all walks of life, Republicans and Democrats, now acknowledge—including Governor Haley, whose recent eloquence on the subject is worthy of praise—as we all have to acknowledge, the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride. For many, Black and White, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now. Removing the flag from this State's capitol would not be an act of political correctness; it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought—the cause of slavery—was wrong. The imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights for all people, was wrong. It would be one step in an honest accounting of America's history; a modest, but meaningful, balm for so many unhealed wounds. It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this State and this country for the better, because of the work of so many people of good will, people of all races striving to form a more perfect Union. By taking down that flag, we express God's grace.
But I don't think God wants us to stop there. For too long, we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps we see that now. Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty or attend dilapidated schools or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career.
Perhaps it causes us to examine what we're doing to cause some of our children to hate. Perhaps it softens hearts towards those lost young men, tens and tens of thousands caught up in the criminal justice system, and lead us to make sure that that system is not infected with bias; that we embrace changes in how we train and equip our police so that the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve make us all safer and more secure.
Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don't realize it, so that we're guarding against not just racial slurs, but we're also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview, but not Jamal; so that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote. By recognizing our common humanity by treating every child as important, regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born, and to do what's necessary to make opportunity real for every American—by doing that, we express God's grace.
For too long——
Audience members. For too long!
The President. For too long, we've been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this Nation. Sporadically, our eyes are open: when 8 of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement, 12 in a movie theater, and 26 in an elementary school. But I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day, the countless more whose lives are forever changed: the survivors crippled, the children traumatized and fearful every day as they walk to school, the husband who will never feel his wife's warm touch, the entire communities whose grief overflows every time they have to watch what happened to them happen to some other place.
The vast majority of Americans—the majority of gun owners—want to do something about this. We see that now. And I'm convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country, by making the moral choice to change, we express God's grace.
We don't earn grace. We're all sinners. We don't deserve it. But God gives it to us anyway. And we choose how to receive it. It's our decision how to honor it.
None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. Every time something like this happens, somebody says we have to have a conversation about race. We talk a lot about race. There's no shortcut. And we don't need more talk. None of us should believe that a handful of gun safety measures will prevent every tragedy. It will not. People of good will will continue to debate the merits of various policies, as our democracy requires. This is a big, raucous place, America is. And there are good people on both sides of these debates. Whatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete.
But it would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again. Once the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual—that's what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society; to settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change—that's how we lose our way again.
It would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families if we merely slipped into old habits, whereby those who disagree with us are not merely wrong, but bad, where we shout instead of listen, where we barricade ourselves behind preconceived notions or well-practiced cynicism.
Reverend Pinckney once said: ""Across the South, we have a deep appreciation of history. We haven't always had a deep appreciation of each other's history."" What is true in the South is true for America. Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other, that my liberty depends on you being free too, that history can't be a sword to justify injustice or a shield against progress, but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, how to break the cycle. A roadway toward a better world. He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind, but more importantly, an open heart.
That's what I've felt this week, an open heart. That, more than any particular policy or analysis, is what's called upon right now, I think; what a friend of mine, the writer Marilynne Robinson, calls ""that reservoir of goodness, beyond, and of another kind, that we are able to do each other in the ordinary cause of things.""
That reservoir of goodness. If we can find that grace, anything is possible. If we can tap that grace, everything can change.
Amazing grace. Amazing grace.
[ At this point, the President sang the first verse of the hymn ""Amazing Grace,"" joined after the first line by audience members, as follows. ]
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost, but now I'm found; was blind but now I see.
[ The President continued his remarks as follows. ]
The President. Clementa Pinckney found that grace. Cynthia Hurd found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Susie Jackson found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Ethel Lance found that grace.
Audience members. Yes! The President. DePayne Middleton-Doctor found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Tywanza Sanders found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Daniel L. Simmons, Sr., found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Myra Thompson found that grace.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Through the example of their lives, they've now passed it on to us. May we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift as long as our lives endure. May grace now lead them home. May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America."
"June 06, 2015","Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden III in Wilmington, Delaware",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-joseph-r-beau-biden-iii-wilmington-delaware,Barack Obama,eulogy,"""A man,"" wrote an Irish poet, ""is original when he speaks the truth that has always been known to all good men."" Beau Biden was an original. He was a good man, a man of character, a man who loved deeply and was loved in return.
Your Eminences, your Excellencies, General Odierno, distinguished guests; to Hallie, Natalie, and Hunter; to Hunter, Kathleen, Ashley, Howard; the rest of Beau's beautiful family, friends, colleagues; to Jill and to Joe: We are here to grieve with you, but more importantly, we are here because we love you.
Without love, life can be cold and it can be cruel. Sometimes, cruelty is deliberate: the action of bullies or bigots or the inaction of those indifferent to another's pain. But often, cruelty is simply born of life, a matter of fate or God's will, beyond our mortal powers to comprehend. To suffer such faceless, seemingly random cruelty can harden the softest hearts or shrink the sturdiest. It can make one mean or bitter or full of self-pity. Or, to paraphrase an old proverb, it can make you beg for a lighter burden.
But if you're strong enough, it can also make you ask God for broader shoulders, shoulders broad enough to bear not only your own burdens, but the burdens of others; shoulders broad enough to shield those who need shelter the most.
To know Beau Biden is to know which choice he made in his life. To know Joe and the rest of the Biden family is to understand why Beau lived the life he did. For Beau, a cruel twist of fate came early: the car accident that took his mom and his sister and confined Beau and Hunter, then still toddlers, to hospital beds at Christmastime.
But Beau was a Biden. And he learned early the Biden family rule: If you have to ask for help, it's too late. It meant you were never alone; you don't even have to ask, because someone is always there for you when you need them.
And so, after the accident, Aunt Valerie rushed in to care for the boys and remained to help raise them. Joe continued public service, but shunned the parlor games of Washington, choosing instead the daily commute home, maintained for decades, that would let him meet his most cherished duty: to see his kids off to school, to kiss them at night, to let them know that the world was stable and that there was firm ground under their feet.
As Joe himself confessed to me, he did not just do this because the kids needed him, he did it because he needed those kids. And somehow, Beau sensed that: how understandably and deeply hurt his family and his father was. And so rather than use his childhood trauma as justification for a life of self-pity or self-centeredness, that very young boy made a very grownup decision: He would live a life of meaning. He would live a life for others. He would ask God for broader shoulders.
Beau would guide and look out for his younger brother. He would embrace his new mom—apparently, the two boys sheepishly asking their father when they could all marry Jill—[ laughter ]—and throughout his life, no one would make Jill laugh harder. He would look after their baby sister Ashley. He would forever be the one to do the right thing, careful not to give his family or his friends cause for concern.
Now, it's no secret that a lot of what made Beau the way he was, was just how much he loved and admired his dad. He studied law, like his dad, even choosing the same law school. He chased public service, like his dad, believing it to be a noble and important pursuit. From his dad, he learned how to get back up when life knocked him down. He learned that he was no higher than anybody else and no lower than anybody else, something Joe got from his mom, by the way. And he learned how to make everybody else feel like we matter, because his dad taught him that everybody matters.
He even looked and sounded like Joe, although, I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade—[ laughter ]—Joe 2.0. [ Laughter ] But as much as Beau reminded folks of Joe, he was very much his own man. He was an original.
Here was a scion of an incredible family who brushed away the possibility of privilege for the harder, better reward of earning his own way. Here was a soldier who dodged glory and exuded true humility, a prosecutor who defended the defenseless, the rare politician who collected more fans than foes, and the rarer public figure who prioritized his private life above all else.
Beau didn't cut corners. He turned down an appointment to be Delaware's attorney general so he could win it fair and square. When the field was clear for him to run for the Senate, he chose to finish his job as AG instead. He didn't do these things to gain favor with a cynical public. It's just who he was. You know, in his twenties, he and a friend were stopped for speeding outside Scranton. And the officer recognized the name on the license, and because he was a fan of Joe's work with law enforcement, he wanted to let Beau off with a warning. But Beau made him write that ticket. Beau didn't trade on his name.
After 9/11, he joined the National Guard. He felt it was his obligation, part of what those broader shoulders are for. He did his duty to his country and deployed to Iraq, and General Odierno eloquently spoke to Major Biden's service. What I can tell you is, when he was loading up to ship out at Dover, there was a lot of press that wanted to interview him. Beau refused. He was just another soldier.
I saw him when I visited Iraq; he conducted himself the same way. His deployment was hard on Hallie and the kids, like it was for so many families over the last 14 years. It was hard on Joe, hard on Jill. It's partly why Jill threw herself into her work with military families with so much intensity. That's how you know when Joe thunders, ""May God protect our troops,"" in every speech he does, he means it so deeply.
Like his father, Beau did not have a mean bone in his body. The cruelty he'd endured in his life didn't make him hard, it made him compassionate, empathetic. But it did make him abhor bullies.
Beau's grandfather, Joe's father, believed that the most egregious sin was to abuse your power to inflict pain on another. So Beau squared his broad shoulders to protect people from that kind of abuse. He fought for homeowners who were cheated, seniors who were scammed. He even went after bullying itself. He set up a Child Protector—Predator Task Force, convicted more than 200 of those who targeted vulnerable children. And in all this, he did it in a way that was alive to the suffering of others, bringing in experts to help spare both the children and their parents further trauma. That's who Beau was: someone who cared, someone who charmed you and disarmed you and put you at ease. When he'd have to attend a fancy fundraiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he'd walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear. [ Laughter ] The son of a Senator, a major in the Army, the most popular elected official in Delaware—I'm sorry, Joe—[ laughter ]—but he was not above dancing in nothing but a sombrero and shorts at Thanksgiving; it would shake loose a laugh from the people he loved. And through it all, he was the consummate public servant, a notebook in his back pocket at all times so he could write down the problems of everyone he met and go back to the office to get them fixed.
Because he was a Biden, the titles that come with family—husband, father, son, brother, uncle—those were the ones Beau valued above any other. This was a man who, at the Democratic National Convention, didn't spend all his time in backrooms with donors or glad-handing. Instead, he rode the escalators in the arena with his son, up and down, up and down, again and again—[ laughter ]—knowing, just like Joe had learned, what ultimately mattered in life.
You know, anyone can make a name for themselves in this reality TV age, especially in today's politics. If you're loud enough or controversial enough, you can get some attention. But to make that name mean something, to have it associated with dignity and integrity, that is rare. There's no shortcut to get it. It's not something you can buy. But if you do right by your children, maybe you can pass it on. And what greater inheritance is there? What greater inheritance than to be part of a family that passes on the values of what it means to be a great parent; that passes on the values of what it means to be a true citizen; that passes on the values of what it means to give back, fully and freely, without expecting anything in return?
That's what our country was built on, men like Beau. That's who built it, families like this. We don't have kings or queens or lords. We don't have to be born into money to have an impact. We don't have to step on one another to be successful. We have this remarkable privilege of being able to earn what we get out of life, with the knowledge that we are no higher than anybody else or lower than anybody else. We know this not just because it is in our founding documents, but because families like the Bidens have made it so, because people like Beau have made it so.
He did in 46 years what most of us couldn't do in 146. He left nothing in the tank. He was a man who led a life where the means were as important as the ends. And the example he set made you want to be a better dad or a better son or a better brother or sister, better at your job, the better soldier. He made you want to be a better person. Isn't that finally the measure of a man, the way he lives, how he treats others, no matter what life may throw at him?
We do not know how long we've got here. We don't know when fate will intervene. We cannot discern God's plan. What we do know is that with every minute that we've got, we can live our lives in a way that takes nothing for granted. We can love deeply. We can help people who need help. We can teach our children what matters and pass on empathy and compassion and selflessness. We can teach them to have broad shoulders.
To the Biden family, this sprawling, intimate clan, I know that Beau's passing has left a gaping void in the world. Hallie, I can only imagine the burdens that you've been carrying on your shoulders these past couple of years. And it's because you gave him everything that he could give everything to us. And just as you were there for him, we'll be there for you. To Natalie and Hunter, there aren't words big enough to describe how much your dad loved you, how much he loved your mom. But I will tell you what, Michelle and I and Sasha and Malia, we've become part of the Biden clan. We're honorary members now. [ Laughter ] And the Biden family rule applies: We're always here for you; we always will be—my word as a Biden. [ Laughter ]
To Joe and Jill, just like everybody else here, Michelle and I thank God you are in our lives. Taking this ride with you is one of the great pleasures of our lives. Joe, you are my brother. And I am grateful every day that you've got such a big heart and a big soul and those broad shoulders. I couldn't admire you more.
I got to know Joe's mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, before she passed away. She was on stage with us when we were first elected. And I know she told Joe once that out of everything bad that happens to you, something good will come if you look hard enough. And I suppose she was channeling that same Irish poet with whom I began today, Patrick Kavanagh, when he wrote, ""And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.""
As hard as it is right now, through all the heartache and through all the tears, it is our obligation to Beau to think not about what was and what might have been, but instead to think about what is, because of him. Think about the day that dawns for children who are safer because of Beau, whose lives are fuller, because of him. Think about the day that dawns for parents who rest easier and families who are freer because of him. Some folks may never know that their lives are better because of Beau Biden. But that's okay. Certainly for Beau, acclaim was never the point of public service.
But the lines of well-wishers who've been here all week, they know. The White House mailroom that's been overflowing with letters from people, those folks know. The soldiers who served with Beau, who joined the National Guard because of him. The workers at Verdi's who still have their home because of him and who thanked him for helping them bus tables one busy night. The students in Newark who remember the time he talked with them for hours, inexhaustible, even after giving a speech, even after taking his National Guard fitness test. The Rehoboth woman who's saved a kind voicemail from him for 5 years and wrote to say, ""I loved the way he loved his family."" And the stranger who wrote from halfway across this great country just to say: ""The only thing we can hope for is that our children make us proud by making a difference in the world. Beau has done that and then some. The world noticed.""
Jill, Joe, Hallie, Hunter, and Natalie: The world noticed. They noticed. They felt it, his presence. And Beau lives on in the lives of others. And isn't that the whole point of our time here? To make this country we love fairer and more just, not just for Natalie and Hunter or Naomi or Finnegan or Maisy or Malia or Sasha, but for every child? Isn't that what this amazing journey we've been on is all about, to make life better for the next generation? Beau figured that out so early in life. What an inheritance Beau left us. What an example he set.
""Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts were touched with fire,"" said Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. ""But, above all, we have learned that whether a man accepts from Fortune her spade, and will look downward and dig, or from Aspiration her axe and cord, and will scale the ice, the one and only success which it is his to command is to bring to his work a mighty heart.""
Beau Biden brought to his work a mighty heart. He brought to his family a mighty heart. What a good man. What an original.
May God bless his memory and the lives of all he touched."
"December 10, 2013","Remarks at the Memorial Service for Former President Nelson R. Mandela of South Africa in Johannesburg, South Africa",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-service-for-former-president-nelson-r-mandela-south-africa,Barack Obama,eulogy,"Thank you. To Graça Machel and the Mandela family; to President Zuma and members of the Government; to heads of states and government, past and present; distinguished guests: It is a singular honor to be with you today, to celebrate a life like no other. To the people of South Africa—people of every race and walk of life—the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us. His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and your hope found expression in his life. And your freedom, your democracy, is his cherished legacy.
It is hard to eulogize any man, to capture in words not just the facts and the dates that make a life, but the essential truth of a person: their private joys and sorrows; the quiet moments and unique qualities that illuminate someone's soul. How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice and, in the process, moved billions around the world.
Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement, a movement that at its start had little prospect for success. Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice. He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev and reached the final days of the cold war. Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would—like Abraham Lincoln—hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. And like America's Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations: a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term.
Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it's tempting, I think, to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears, his miscalculations along with his victories. ""I am not a saint,"" he said, ""unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.""
It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection—because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens that he carried—that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble, he was a man of flesh and blood: a son and a husband, a father and a friend. And that's why we learned so much from him, and that's why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness and persistence and faith. He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well.
Mandela showed us the power of action, of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Mandela was right that he inherited, ""a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness"" from his father. And we know he shared with millions of Black and colored South Africans the anger born of, ""a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments . . . a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,"" he said.
But like other early giants of the ANC—the Sisulus and Tambos—Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization and platforms and strategies for action so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price: ""I have fought against White domination, and I have fought against Black domination. I've cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""
Mandela has taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas, the importance of reason and arguments, the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don't agree with. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls or extinguished by a sniper's bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades of prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day, he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his.
Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles, he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the apartheid regime that ""prisoners cannot enter into contracts.""
But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement, but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights and the precious freedoms of every South African.
And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa, ubuntu , a word that captures Mandela's greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others and caring for those around us.
We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small—introducing his jailers as honored guests at his Inauguration, taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform, turning his family's heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS—that revealed the depths of his empathy and his understanding. He not only embodied ubuntu , he taught millions to find that truth within themselves.
It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth. He changed laws, but he also changed hearts.
For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madiba's passing is rightly a time of mourning and a time to celebrate a heroic life. But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask, how well have I applied his lessons in my own life? It's a question I ask myself, as a man and as a President.
We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice—the sacrifices of countless people, known and unknown—to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle. But in America and in South Africa and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done.
The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important. For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. We still see run-down schools. We still see young people without prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs and are still persecuted for what they look like and how they worship and who they love. That is happening today.
And so we too must act on behalf of justice. We too must act on behalf of peace. There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba's legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba's struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.
The questions we face today—how to promote equality and justice, how to uphold freedom and human rights, how to end conflict and sectarian war—these things do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I. Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows that is true. South Africa shows we can change, that we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity.
We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa and the young people around the world: You too can make his life's work your own. Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba's example, he makes me want to be a better man. He speaks to what's best inside us.
After this great liberator is laid to rest, and when we have returned to our cities and villages and rejoined our daily routines, let us search for his strength. Let us search for his largeness of spirit somewhere inside of ourselves. And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, when our best laid plans seem beyond our reach, let us think of Madiba and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell:
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.
What a magnificent soul it was. We will miss him deeply. May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela. May God bless the people of South Africa."
"October 29, 2013",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas S. Foley,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-former-speaker-the-house-representatives-thomas-s-foley,Barack Obama,eulogy,"To Heather and the Foley family; to Tom's colleagues and friends; President Clinton; Vice President Mondale; former Speakers; and those who preceded me: I am honored to join you today to remember a man who embodied the virtues of devotion and respect for the institution that he led, for the colleagues that he served alongside, and most importantly, for the citizens that he had the honor to represent.
Unlike so many of you, I did not have the privilege of knowing Tom personally; I admired him from afar. But like millions of Americans, I benefit from his legacy. Thanks to Tom, more children get a Head Start on success in school and in life. More seniors receive better health care. More families breathe easier because they know their country will be there for them in times of need. And all of them—all of us—are indebted to that towering man from Spokane.
I think, in listening to the wonderful memories that have been shared, we get a sense of this man, and we recognize his humility. He often attributed much of his success to good luck, and he may have had a point. Leader McConnell told the story about his first race; there were a couple of details that got left out. On the way to Olympia to file the paperwork for his first congressional campaign, apparently, Tom blew out a tire. [ Laughter ] So he and some friends hitchhiked to a service station to get it fixed. And then, as they approached the outskirts of the city, they ran out of gas. So they pushed the car up the hill, coasting into town just before the deadline. And Tom went on to win that race by a resounding 54 votes.
So there's no question that there may have been some luck of the Irish operating when it came to Tom Foley, as well as incredible stamina. But what led him to make history as the first Speaker of the House from west of the Rockies was not luck. It was his hard work and his deep integrity and his powerful intellect, and as Bob Michel so eloquently and movingly stated, his ability to find common ground with his colleagues across the aisle. And it was his personal decency that helped him bring civility and order to a Congress that demanded both and still does.
Which brings me to a final point: At a time when our political system can seem more polarized and more divided than ever before, it can be tempting to see the possibility of bipartisan progress as a thing of the past, ""old school,"" as Bob said. It can be tempting to wonder if we still have room for leaders like Tom, whether the environment, the media, the way that districts are drawn, and the pressures that those of us in elected office are under somehow preclude the possibility of that brand of leadership. Well, I believe we have to find our way back there.
Now more than ever, America needs public servants who are willing to place problem-solving ahead of politics, as the letter that President Clinton held up indicates, as the history of the crime bill shows. We are sent here to do what's right, and sometimes, doing what's right is hard. And it's not free. And yet that's the measure of leadership.
It's important for us who feel a responsibility to fight for a cause to recognize that our cause is not advanced if we can't also try to achieve compromise, the same way our Founders saw it: as a vital part of our democracy, the very thing that makes our system of self-government possible. That's what Tom Foley believed. That's what he embodied. That's the legacy that shines brightly today.
Now, on the last day that he presided as Speaker, Tom described what it should feel like to serve the American people in this city. He spoke about coming to work in the morning and catching a glimpse of the Capitol. And he said that it ought to give anyone a thrill, a sense not only of personal satisfaction, ""but very deep gratitude to our constituents for the honor of letting us represent them."" And Tom never lost that sense of wonder.
It's interesting—as I read that passage, what he wrote—the first time I visited Capitol Hill, Tom Foley was Speaker. I was a very young man and I was doing community work, and I remember seeing that Capitol and having that same sense of wonder. And I think now about Tom Foley being here doing that work and inspiring what might have ultimately led me to be interested in public service as well.
When we're standing outside these magnificent buildings, we have that sense of wonder and that sense of hope. And sometimes, the longer you're here, the harder it is to hang on to that. And yet Tom Foley never lost it—never lost that sense of wonder, never lost the sense of gratitude. What a privilege, he felt it was, to serve. And he never forgot why he came here: on behalf of this Nation and his State and the citizens that he loved and respected so much.
And so, as a country, we have to be grateful to him. And to Heather and to the people of the great State of Washington, thank you so much for sharing Tom with us.
God bless Tom Foley. God bless the United States of America."
"December 21, 2012",Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Senator Daniel K. Inouye,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-senator-daniel-k-inouye,Barack Obama,eulogy,"To Irene, Ken, Jennifer, Danny's friends, and former colleagues, it is an extraordinary honor to be with you in this magnificent place to pay tribute to a man who'd probably be wondering what all the fuss is about.
This Tuesday was in many ways a day like any other. The Sun rose, the Sun set, the great work of our democracy carried on. But in a fundamental sense, it was different. It was the first day in many of our lives, certainly my own, that the halls of the United States Congress were not graced by the presence of Daniel Ken Inouye.
Danny was elected to the U.S. Senate when I was 2 years old. He had been elected to Congress a couple of years before I was born. He would remain my Senator until I left Hawaii for college.
Now, even though my mother and grandparents took great pride that they had voted for him, I confess that I wasn't paying much attention to the United States Senate at the age of 4 or 5 or 6. It wasn't until I was 11 years old that I recall even learning what a U.S. Senator was, or it registering at least. It was during my summer vacation with my family, my first trip to what those of us in Hawaii call the Mainland.
So we flew over the ocean, and with my mother and my grandmother and my sister, who at the time was 2, we traveled around the country. It was a big trip. We went to Seattle, and we went to Disneyland, which was most important. We traveled to Kansas, where my grandmother's family was from, and went to Chicago and went to Yellowstone. And we took Greyhound buses most of the time, and we rented cars, and we'd stay at local motels or Howard Johnsons. And if there was a pool at one of these motels, even if it was just tiny, I would be very excited. And the ice machine was exciting, and the vending machine, I was really excited about that.
But this is at a time when you didn't have 600 stations and 24 hours' worth of cartoons. And so, at night, if the TV was on, it was what your parents decided to watch. And my mother, that summer, would turn on the TV every night during this vacation and watch the Watergate hearings. And I can't say that I understood everything that was being discussed, but I knew the issues were important. I knew they spoke to some basic way about who we were and who we might be as Americans.
And so, slowly, during the course of this trip, which lasted about a month, some of this seeped into my head. And the person who fascinated me most was this man of Japanese descent with one arm, speaking in this courtly baritone, full of dignity and grace. And maybe he captivated my attention because my mom explained that this was our Senator and that he was upholding what our Government was all about. Maybe it was a boyhood fascination with the story of how he had lost his arm in war. But I think it was more than that.
Now, here I was, a young boy with a White mom, a Black father, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii. And I was beginning to sense how fitting into the world might not be as simple as it might seem. And so to see this man, this Senator, this powerful, accomplished person, who wasn't out of central casting when it came to what you'd think a Senator might look like at the time, and the way he commanded the respect of an entire nation, I think it hinted to me what might be possible in my own life.
This was a man who as a teenager stepped up to serve his country even after his fellow Japanese Americans were declared enemy aliens; a man who believed in America even when its Government didn't necessarily believe in him. That meant something to me. It gave me a powerful sense—one that I couldn't put into words—a powerful sense of hope.
And as I watched those hearings, listening to Danny ask all those piercing questions night after night, I learned something else. I learned how our democracy was supposed to work, our Government of and by and for the people; that we have a system of Government where nobody is above the law; where we have an obligation to hold each other accountable, from the average citizen to the most powerful of leaders, because these things that we stand for, these ideals that we hold dear, are bigger than any one person or party or politician.
And somehow, nobody communicated that more effectively than Danny Inouye. You got a sense, as Joe mentioned, of just a fundamental integrity, that he was a proud Democrat, but most importantly, he was a proud American. And were it not for those two insights planted in my head at the age of 11, in between Disneyland and a trip to Yellowstone, I might never have considered a career in public service. I might not be standing here today.
I think it's fair to say that Danny Inouye was perhaps my earliest political inspiration. And then, for me to have the privilege of serving with him, to be elected to the United States Senate and arrive, and one of my first visits is to go to his office, and for him to greet me as a colleague and treat me with the same respect that he treated everybody he met, and to sit me down and give me advice about how the Senate worked and then regale me with some stories about wartime and his recovery, stories full of humor—never bitterness, never boastfulness—just matter of fact. Some of them, I must admit, a little offcolor. I couldn't probably repeat them in the Cathedral. There's a side of Danny that—well. [ Laughter ]
Danny once told his son his service to this country had been for the children, for all the sons and daughters who deserve to grow up in a nation that never questioned their patriotism. This is my country, he said. Many of us have fought hard for the right to say that. And obviously, Ric Shinseki described what it meant for Japanese Americans, but my point is, is that when he referred to our sons and daughters, he wasn't just talking about Japanese Americans. He was talking about all of us. He was talking about those who serve today who might have been excluded in the past. He was talking about me.
And that's who Danny was. For him, freedom and dignity were not abstractions. They were values that he had bled for, ideas he had sacrificed for, rights he understood as only someone can who has had them threatened, had them taken away.
The valor that earned him our Nation's highest military decoration—a story so incredible that when you actually read the accounts, you think this, you couldn't make this up; it's like out of an action movie—that valor was so rooted in a deep and abiding love of this country. And he believed, as we say in Hawaii, that we're a single ' ohana , that we're one family. And he devoted his life to making that family strong.
After experiencing the horror of war himself, Danny also felt a profound connection to those who follow. It wasn't unusual for him to take time out of his busy schedule to sit down with a veteran or a fellow amputee, trading stories, telling jokes; two heroes, generations apart, sharing an unspoken bond that was forged in battle and tempered in peace. In no small measure, because of Danny's service, our military is, and will always remain, the best in the world, and we recognize our sacred obligation to give our veterans the care they deserve.
Of course, Danny didn't always take credit for the difference he made. Ever humble, one of the only landmarks that bear his name is a Marine Corps mess hall in Hawaii. And when someone asked him how he wanted to be remembered, Danny said: ""I represented the people of Hawaii and this Nation honestly and to the best of my ability. I think I did okay.""
Danny, you were more than okay. You were extraordinary.
It's been mentioned that Danny ended his convention speech in Chicago in 1968 with the word ""aloha."" ""To some of you who visited us, it may have meant hello,"" he said, but ""to others, it may have meant goodbye. Those of us who've been privileged to live in Hawaii understand aloha means I love you.""
And as someone who has been privileged to live in Hawaii, I know that he embodied the very best of that spirit, the very best of ""aloha."" It's fitting it was the last word that Danny spoke on this Earth. He may have been saying goodbye to us. Maybe he was saying hello to someone waiting on the other side. But it was a final expression, most of all, of his love for the family and friends that he cared so much about, for the men and women he was honored to serve with, for the country that held such a special place in his heart.
And so we remember a man who inspired all of us with his courage and moved us with his compassion, that inspired us with his integrity, and who taught so many of us, including a young boy growing up in Hawaii, that America has a place for everyone.
May God bless Daniel Inouye. And may God grant us more souls like his."
"January 14, 2011",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Former United States Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard C. Holbrooke,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-former-united-states-special-representative-for-afghanistan,Barack Obama,eulogy,"To Kati, Anthony, David, and Elizabeth, to all the friends and admirers of Richard, we come together to celebrate an extraordinary life.
In 1999, at the height of the crisis in Kosovo, Richard gave an interview in which he addressed the question of why the United States was engaged in bringing peace to that war-torn corner of the world. Why bother? His answer was simple: ""Because we could make a difference."" Because we could make a difference.
That is the story of American leadership in the world. And that is also the story of Richard Holbrooke. He made a difference.
In 1962, when he was just 22 years old, he set out for Vietnam as a Foreign Service officer. He could not have known the twists and turns that lay ahead of him and his country in that war or the road that he would travel over nearly five decades of service to his country. But it's no coincidence that his life story so closely paralleled the major events of his times.
The list of places he served and the things he did reads as a chronicle of American foreign policy: speaking truth to power from the Mekong Delta to the Paris peace talks, paving the way to our normalization of relations with China, serving as Ambassador in a newly unified Germany, bringing peace to the Balkans, strengthening our relationship with the United Nations, and working to advance peace and progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Richard came of an age looking up to the men who had helped shape the postwar world: Dean Acheson, Averell Harriman, Clark Clifford, Dean Rusk. And in many ways, he was the leading light of a generation of American diplomats who came of age in Vietnam.
It was a generation that came to know both the tragic limits and awesome possibilities of American power: born at a time of triumph in World War II, steeped in the painful lessons of Southeast Asia, participants in the twilight struggle that led ultimately to freedom's triumph during the cold war.
After the shadow of communism lifted along with the Iron Curtain, Richard understood that America could not retreat from the world. He recognized that our prosperity is tied to that of others, that our security is endangered by instability abroad, and most importantly, that our moral leadership is at stake when innocent men, women, and children are slaughtered through senseless violence, whether it's in Srebrenica or Islamabad.
Richard possessed a hardheaded, clear-eyed realism about how the world works. He was not naive, but he also believed that America has a unique responsibility in the course of human events. He understood American power, in all its complexity, and believed that when it is applied with purpose and principle, it can tip the scales of history. And that coupling of realism and idealism, which has always represented what is best in American foreign policy, that was at the heart of his work in Bosnia, where he negotiated and cajoled and threatened all at once, until peace was the only outcome possible.
And by the time I came to know Richard, his place in history was assured. His options in the private sector, where so many of his peers had settled, were too numerous to mention. But from my first conversation with him in Chicago, in my transition office, a conversation in which he teared up when he began to talk about the importance of restoring America's place in the world, it was clear that Richard was not comfortable on the sidelines. He belonged in the arena.
To Kati and to his wonderful family, I am personally grateful. I know that every hour he spent with me in the Situation Room or spent traveling to Southeast Asia, South Asia, was time spent away from you. You shared in his sacrifice, and that sacrifice is made greater because he loved you so. He served his country until his final moments.
Those who take the measure of his last mission will see his foresight. He understood that the futures of Afghanistan and Pakistan are tied together. In Afghanistan, he cultivated areas like agriculture and governance to seed stability. With Pakistan, he created new habits of cooperation to overcome decades of mistrust. And globally, he helped align the approaches of 49 nations.
Were he here with us, I know Richard would credit the extraordinary team that he assembled. And today I'd like to make a personal appeal to the SRAP team, particularly the young people: Stay in public service, serve your country, seek the peace that your mentor so ardently sought. I also know that Richard would want us to lift up the next generation of public servants, particularly our diplomats, who so rarely receive credit. And so I'm proud to announce the creation of an annual Richard C. Holbrooke Award to honor excellence in American diplomacy.
As we look to the next generation, it is fitting, as David mentioned, that this memorial take place at the Kennedy Center, named for the President who called Richard's generation to serve. It's also fitting that this memorial takes place at a time when our Nation has recently received a tragic reminder that we must never take our public servants for granted and must always honor their work.
America is not defined by ethnicity. It's not defined by geography. We are a nation born of an idea, a commitment to human freedom.
And over the last five decades, there have been countless times when people made the mistake of counting on America's decline or disengagement. Time and again, those voices have been proven wrong, but only because of the service and sacrifice of exceptional men and women, those who answered the call of history and made America's cause their own.
Like the country he served, Richard contained complexities. So full of life, he was a man both confident in himself and curious about others, alive to the world around him with a character that is captured in the words of a Mathew Arnold poem that he admired:
But often, in the din of strife, there rises an unspeakable desire after the knowledge of the buried life; [the] thirst to spend our fire and restless force in tracking our true, original course; a longing to inquire into the mystery of this heart which beats so wild, so deep in us--to know whence our lives come and where they go.
Richard is gone now, but we carry with us his thirst to know, to grasp, and to heal the world around him. His legacy is seen in the children of Bosnia who lived to raise families of their own, in a Europe that is peaceful and united and free, in young boys and girls from the tribal regions of Pakistan to whom he pledged our country's friendship, and in the role that America continues to play as a light to all who aspire to live in freedom and in dignity.
Five decades after a young President called him to serve, we can confidently say that Richard bore the burden to assure the survival and success of liberty. He made a difference. Let us now carry that work forward in our time.
May God bless the memory of Richard Holbrooke, and may God bless the United States of America."
"July 02, 2010","Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Senator Robert C. Byrd in Charleston, West Virginia",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-senator-robert-c-byrd-charleston-west-virginia,Barack Obama,eulogy,"Thank you. To Mona and Marjorie and to Senator Byrd's entire family, including those adorable great-granddaughters that I had a chance to meet, Michelle and I offer you our deepest sympathies.
To Senator Byrd's friends, including the Speaker of the House, the majority leader, the Republican leader, President Clinton, Vice President Biden, Vicki Kennedy, Nick Rahall, and all the previous speakers; Senator Rockefeller for the outstanding work that you've done for the State of West Virginia; to his larger family, the people of West Virginia: I want you all to know that all America shares your loss. May we all find comfort in a verse of Scripture that reminds me of our dear friend: ""The time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.""
It's interesting that you've heard that passage from several speakers now, because it embodies somebody who knew how to run a good and long race and somebody who knew how to keep the faith, with his State, with his family, with his country, and his Constitution.
Years from now, when I think of the man we memorialize today, I'll remember him as he was when I came to know him, his white hair full like a mane, his gait steadied with a cane. Determined to make the most of every last breath, the distinguished gentleman from West Virginia could be found at his desk until the very end, doing the people's business, delivering soul-stirring speeches, a hint of the Appalachians in his voice, stabbing the air with his finger, fiery as ever, years into his tenth decade.
He was a Senate icon. He was a party leader. He was an elder statesman. And he was my friend. That's how I'll remember him.
Today we remember the path he climbed to such extraordinary peaks. Born Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr.--Corny, he joked, for short--his mother lost her life in the great influenza pandemic of 1918. From the aunt and uncle who raised him, amid West Virginia's coal camps, he gained not only his Byrd name but a reverence for God Almighty, a love of learning that was nurtured at Mark Twain School. And there he met Erma, his sweetheart for over 70 years, by whose side he will now rest for eternity.
Unable to afford college, he did what he could to get by, finding work as a gas station attendant, a produce salesman, a meat cutter, and a welder in the shipyards of Baltimore and Tampa during World War II. Returning home to West Virginia after the war, he ran for the State House of Delegates, using his fiddle case as a briefcase, the better to stand out on the stump.
Before long, he ran for Congress, serving in the House before jumping over to the Senate, where he was elected nine times, held almost every leadership role imaginable, and proved as capable of swaying others as standing alone, marking a row of milestones along the way: longest serving Member of Congress; nearly 19,000 votes cast; not a single loss at the polls, a record that speaks to the bond that he had with you, the people of his State.
Transplanted to Washington, his heart remained here, in West Virginia, in the place that shaped him, with the people he loved. His heart belonged to you. Making life better here was his only agenda. Giving you hope, he said, was his greatest achievement. Hope in the form of new jobs and industries. Hope in the form of black lung benefits and union protections. Hope through roads and research centers, schools and scholarships, health clinics and industrial parks that bear his name.
His early rival and late friend, Ted Kennedy, used to joke about campaigning in West Virginia. When his bus broke down, Ted got hold of the highway patrol, who asked where he was. And he said, ""I'm on Robert Byrd Highway."" And the dispatcher said, ""Which one?"" [ Laughter ]
It's a life that immeasurably improved the lives of West Virginians. Of course, Robert Byrd was a deeply religious man, a Christian. And so he understood that our lives are marked by sins as well as virtues, failures as well as successes, weakness as well as strength. We know there are things he said and things he did that he came to regret. I remember talking about that the first time I visited with him. He said: ""There are things I regretted in my youth. You may know that."" And I said, ""None of us are absent some regrets, Senator. That's why we enjoy and seek the grace of God.""
And as I reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice. Like the Constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our Nation itself, Robert Byrd possessed that quintessential American quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect.
Over his nearly six decades in our Capitol, he came to be seen as the very embodiment of the Senate, chronicling its history in four volumes that he gave to me just as he gave to President Clinton. I too read it. I was scared he was going to quiz me. [ Laughter ]
But as I soon discovered, his passion for the Senate's past, his mastery of even its most arcane procedures, it wasn't an obsession with the trivial or the obscure; it reflected a profoundly noble impulse, a recognition of a basic truth about this country that we are not a nation of men, we are a nation of laws. Our way of life rests on our democratic institutions. Precisely because we are fallible, it falls to each of us to safeguard these institutions, even when it's inconvenient, and pass on our Republic more perfect than before.
Considering the vast learning of this self-taught Senator--his speeches sprinkled with the likes of Cicero and Shakespeare and Jefferson--it seems fitting to close with one of his favorite passages in literature, a passage from ""Moby Dick"":
And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than any other bird upon the plain, even though they soar.
Robert Byrd was a mountain eagle, and his lowest swoop was still higher than the other birds upon the plain.
May God bless Robert C. Byrd. May he be welcomed kindly by the Righteous Judge, and may his spirit soar forever like a Catskill eagle, high above the Heavens. Thank you very much."
"April 29, 2010",Eulogy at a Funeral Service for Civil Rights Activist Dorothy I. Height,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-funeral-service-for-civil-rights-activist-dorothy-i-height,Barack Obama,eulogy,"The President. Please be seated. Let me begin by saying a word to Dr. Dorothy Height's sister, Ms. Aldridge. To some she was a mentor, to all she was a friend, but to you she was family, and my family offers yours our sympathy for your loss.
We are gathered here today to celebrate the life and mourn the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height. It is fitting that we do so here, in our National Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Here in a place of great honor. Here in the House of God, surrounded by the love of family and of friends. The love in this sanctuary is a testament to a life lived righteously, a life that lifted other lives, a life that changed this country for the better over the course of nearly one century here on Earth.
Michelle and I didn't know Dr. Height as well, or as long, as many of you. We were reminded during a previous moment in the service, when you have a nephew who's 88--[ Laughter ]--you've lived a full life.
But we did come to know her in the early days of my campaign. And we came to love her, as so many loved her. We came to love her stories. And we loved her smile. And we loved those hats--[ Laughter ]--that she wore like a crown--regal. In the White House, she was a regular. She came by not once, not twice; 21 times she stopped by the White House. [ Laughter ] Took part in our discussions around health care reform in her final months.
Last February, I was scheduled to see her and other civil rights leaders to discuss the pressing problems of unemployment--Reverend Sharpton, Ben Jealous of the NAACP, Marc Morial of the National Urban League. Then we discovered that Washington was about to be blanketed by the worst blizzard in record--2 feet of snow.
So I suggested to one of my aides, we should call Dr. Height and say we're happy to reschedule the meeting. Certainly if the others come, she should not feel obliged. True to form, Dr. Height insisted on coming, despite the blizzard, never mind that she was in a wheelchair. She was not about to let just a bunch of men--[ Laughter ]--in this meeting. It was only when the car literally could not get to her driveway that she reluctantly decided to stay home. But she still sent a message--[ Laughter ]--about what needed to be done.
And I tell that story partly because it brings a smile to my face, but also because it captures the quiet, dogged, dignified persistence that all of us who loved Dr. Height came to know so well, an attribute that we understand she learned early on.
Born in the capital of the old Confederacy, brought north by her parents as part of that great migration, Dr. Height was raised in another age, in a different America, beyond the experience of many. It's hard to imagine, I think, life in the first decades of that last century when the elderly woman that we knew was only a girl. Jim Crow ruled the South. The Klan was on the rise, a powerful political force. Lynching was all too often the penalty for the offense of black skin. Slaves had been freed within living memory, but too often, their children, their grandchildren remained captive, because they were denied justice and denied equality, denied opportunity, denied a chance to pursue their dreams.
The progress that followed, progress that so many of you helped to achieve, progress that ultimately made it possible for Michelle and me to be here as President and First Lady, that progress came slowly.
That progress came from the collective efforts of multiple generations of Americans. From preachers and lawyers and thinkers and doers, men and women like Dr. Height, who took it upon themselves, often at great risk, to change this country for the better. From men like W.E.B Du Bois and A. Philip Randolph, women like Mary McLeod Bethune and Betty Friedan, they're Americans whose names we know. They are leaders whose legacies we teach. They are giants who fill our history books. Well, Dr. Dorothy Height deserves a place in this pantheon. She too deserves a place in our history books. She too deserves a place of honor in America's memory.
Look at her body of work: desegregating the YWCA; laying the groundwork for integration on Wednesdays in Mississippi; lending pigs to poor farmers as a sustainable source of income; strategizing with civil rights leaders, holding her own, the only woman in the room, Queen Esther to this Moses generation, even as she led the National Council of Negro Women with vision and energy, vision and class.
But we remember her not solely for all she did during the civil rights movement. We remember her for all she did over a lifetime, behind the scenes, to broaden the movement's reach, to shine a light on stable families and tight-knit communities, to make us see the drive for civil rights and women's rights not as a separate struggle, but as part of a larger movement to secure the rights of all humanity, regardless of gender, regardless of race, regardless of ethnicity.
It's an unambiguous record of righteous work, worthy of remembrance, worthy of recognition. And yet one of the ironies is, is that year after year, decade in, decade out, Dr. Height went about her work quietly, without fanfare, without self-promotion. She never cared about who got the credit. She didn't need to see her picture in the papers. She understood that the movement gathered strength from the bottom up, those unheralded men and women who don't always make it into the history books but who steadily insisted on their dignity, on their manhood and womenhood. She wasn't interested in credit. What she cared about was the cause--the cause of justice, the cause of equality, the cause of opportunity--freedom's cause.
And that willingness to subsume herself, that humility and that grace, is why we honor Dr. Dorothy Height. As it is written in the Gospel of Matthew: ""For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."" I don't think the author of the Gospel would mind me rephrasing: ""whoever humbles herself will be exalted.""
One of my favorite moments with Dr. Height--this is just a few months ago--we had decided to put up the Emancipation Proclamation in the Oval Office, and we invited some elders to share reflections of the movement. And she came, and it was a intergenerational event, so we had young children there as well as elders, and the elders were asked to share stories. And she talked about attending a dinner in the 1940s at the home of Dr. Benjamin Mays, then president of Morehouse College. And seated at the table that evening was a 15-year-old student, ""a gifted child,"" as she described him, filled with a sense of purpose, who was trying to decide whether to enter medicine or law or the ministry.
And many years later, after that gifted child had become a gifted preacher--I'm sure he had been told to be on his best behavior--after he led a bus boycott in Montgomery and inspired a nation with his dreams, he delivered a sermon on what he called ""the drum major instinct,"" a sermon that said we all have the desire to be first, we all want to be at the front of the line.
The great test of a life, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, is to harness that instinct, to redirect it towards advancing the greater good, toward changing a community and a country for the better, toward doing the Lord's work.
I sometimes think Dr. King must have had Dorothy Height in mind when he gave that speech. For Dorothy Height met the test. Dorothy Height embodied that instinct. Dorothy Height was a drum major for justice, a drum major for equality, a drum major for freedom, a drum major for service. And the lesson she would want us to leave with today--a lesson she lived out each and every day--is that we can all be first in service. We can all be drum majors for a righteous cause. So let us live out that lesson. Let us honor her life by changing this country for the better as long as we are blessed to live. May God bless Dr. Dorothy Height and the Union that she made more perfect."
"September 09, 2009",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Walter L. Cronkite in New York City,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-walter-l-cronkite-new-york-city,Barack Obama,eulogy,"Thank you very much. Thank you.
To Chip, Kathy, and Nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him; to Walter's friends, colleagues, proteges, and all who considered him a hero; to the men of the Intrepid ; to all of you who are gathered here today: I am honored to be here to pay tribute to the life and times of the man who chronicled our time.
I did not know Mr. Cronkite personally, and my regret is made more acute by the stories that have been shared here today. Nor, for that matter, did I know him any better than the tens of millions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question: What happened today? But like them and like all of you, I have benefited as a citizen from his dogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view that journalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital to our democracy.
Even in his early career, Walter Cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favor of getting it right. He wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting it right. During one of his first jobs in Kansas City, Walter's program manager urged him to go on the air reporting a massive blaze—and we just heard how much he loved fires—[ laughter ]—a massive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives. When Walter reached for the telephone, his boss asked, ""What are you doing? Get on the air!"" Walter replied that he was calling the fire department to confirm the story. ""You don't need to confirm it,"" the manager shouted, ""my wife's watching the whole thing!"" [ Laughter ]
Needless to say, Walter made the call, and even as the program manager took the air himself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, Walter discovered that it had been nothing more than a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries. He lost his job, but he got the story right.
Walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, but he never dared to compromise his integrity. He got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of one another's motives. One politician once remarked, ""Walter, my friend, you've got to believe me; fully 85 percent of everything I told you today is the absolute truth."" [ Laughter ]
He shared a complicated relationship with Presidents of both parties, who wanted him on their side even as they were convinced that he wasn't. President Johnson called Walter after the evening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story. But Walter knew that if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job.
His endless inquisitiveness about our world, I can imagine, came from a mother who sold encyclopedias for a living. As a boy, Walter spent countless hours getting lost within their pages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from one another, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked.
And that's the way he lived his life, with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to make sense of it, and explaining it to others. He went everywhere, and he did everything. He raced cars and boats; he traveled everywhere from the Amazon to the Arctic; he plunged 8,000 feet below the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the Himalayas, and experienced weightlessness in the upper reaches of our atmosphere, all with one mission: to make it come alive for the rest of us.
And as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes. He was forever there, reporting through World War and cold war, marches and milestones, scandal and success, calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know. He was a voice of certainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain. And through it all, he never lost the integrity or the plain-spoken speaking style that he gained growing up in the heartland. He was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of us personally.
So it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in America. But here's the thing: That title wasn't bestowed on him by a network. We weren't told to believe it by some advertising campaign. It was earned. It was earned by year after year and decade after decade of painstaking effort, a commitment to fundamental values, his belief that the American people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied by theater or spectacle. He didn't believe in dumbing down. He trusted us.
When he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in America, he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife. [ Laughter ] When people of both political parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for his stances on the issues, he said no, to the relief of all potential opponents. And when, even a decade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories for television journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category, attractiveness. [ Laughter ]
Through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments of deepest hurt and brightest hope, Walter Cronkite was there, telling the story of the American age. And this is how we remember him today. But we also remember and celebrate the journalism that Walter practiced, a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which so many of you have committed your careers. It's a standard that's a little bit harder to find today. We know that this is a difficult time for journalism. Even as appetites for news and information grow, newsrooms are closing. Despite the big stories of our era, serious journalists find themselves all too often without a beat. Just as the news cycle has shrunk, so has the bottom line.
And too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softer stories that Walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism he championed. ""What happened today?"" is replaced with ""Who won today?"" The public debate cheapens. The public trust falters. We fail to understand our world or one another as well as we should, and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our Nation. We seem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as a society. Which price is higher to pay? Which cost is harder to bear?
""This democracy,"" Walter said, ""cannot function without a reasonably well informed electorate."" That's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of you pursue with the same zeal that Walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society. Our future depends on it.
Now, Walter was no naive idealist. He understood the challenges and the pressures and the temptations facing journalism in this new era. He believed that a media company has an obligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit back into news and public affairs. He was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world of journalism would be able to tell and all the newly emerging means with which to tell it.
Naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories of our time. In an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at the speed of the Internet, would he still have called to doublecheck? Would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and the sound bites to shine the bright light on substance? Could he still offer the perspective that we value? Would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindling attention spans and omnipresent media?
And somehow, we know that the answer is yes. The simple values Walter Cronkite set out in pursuit of—to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could—they are as vital today as they ever were.
Our American story continues. It needs to be told. And if we choose to live up to Walter's example, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself as part of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve to value it once again, then I'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a false one and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead.
Walter Cronkite invited a nation to believe in him, and he never betrayed that trust. That's why so many of you entered the profession in the first place, that's why the standards he set for journalists still stand, and that's why he loved and valued all of you. But we loved and valued Walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society.
He's reunited with his beloved Betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold with boundless optimism, every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful ""Oh, boy!"" [ Laughter ] We are grateful to him for altering and illuminating our time and for the opportunity he gave to us to say that, yes, we too were there.
Thank you very much."
"August 29, 2009","Eulogy at the Funeral Service for Senator Edward M. Kennedy in Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-funeral-service-for-senator-edward-m-kennedy-boston-massachusetts,Barack Obama,eulogy,"Your Eminence, Vicki, Kara, Edward, Patrick, Curran, Caroline, members of the Kennedy family, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today we say goodbye to the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy. The world will long remember their son Edward as the heir to a weighty legacy, a champion for those who had none, the soul of the Democratic Party, and the lion of the United States Senate, a man who graces nearly 1,000 laws and who penned more than 300 laws himself.
But those of us who loved him and ache with his passing know Ted Kennedy by the other titles he held: father; brother; husband; grandfather; Uncle Teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews, ""the Grand Fromage,"" or ""the Big Cheese."" I, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearly half a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, as a friend.
Ted Kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch, the restless dreamer who became its rock. He was the sunny, joyful child who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing but learned quickly how to brush it off. When they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, 6-year-old Teddy got back in and learned to sail. When a photographer asked the newly elected Bobby to step back at a press conference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, Teddy quipped, ""It'll be the same in Washington.""
That spirit of resilience and good humor would see Teddy through more pain and tragedy than most of us will ever know. He lost two siblings by the age of 16. He saw two more taken violently from a country that loved them. He said goodbye to his beloved sister, Eunice, in the final days of his life. He narrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, and experienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible.
It's a string of events that would have broken a lesser man. And it would have been easy for Ted to let himself become bitter and hardened, to surrender to self-pity and regret, to retreat from public life and live out his years in peaceful quiet. No one would have blamed him for that.
But that was not Ted Kennedy. As he told us: ""[I]ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in and no exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves."" Indeed, Ted was the ""Happy Warrior"" that the poet Wordsworth spoke of when he wrote:
As tempted more; more able to endure,
As more exposed to suffering and distress;
Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
Through his own suffering, Ted Kennedy became more alive to the plight and the suffering of others: the sick child who could not see a doctor; the young soldier denied her rights because of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from. The landmark laws that he championed—the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, immigration reform, children's health insurance, the Family and Medical Leave Act—all have a running thread: that's Kennedy's life work was not to champion the causes of those with wealth or power or special connections; it was to give a voice to those who were not heard, to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity, to make real the dream of our founding. He was given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow.
We can still hear his voice bellowing through the Senate Chamber, face reddened, fists pounding the podium, a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights. And yet, as has been noted, while his causes became deeply personal, his disagreements never did. While he was seen by his fiercest critics as a partisan lightning rod, that's not the prism through which Ted Kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prism through which his colleagues saw Ted Kennedy. He was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politics prevented differences of party and platform and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect, a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots.
And that's how Ted Kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time. He did it by hewing to principle, yes, but also by seeking compromise and common cause, not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, but through friendship and kindness and humor. There was the time he courted Orrin Hatch for support of the Children's Health Insurance Program by having his chief of staff serenade the Senator with a song Orrin had written himself, the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crusty Republican colleague, the famous story of how he won the support of a Texas committee chairman on an immigration bill. Teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope and showed only the chairman that it was filled with the Texan's favorite cigars. When the negotiations were going well, he would inch the envelope closer to the chairman. [ Laughter ] When they weren't, he'd pull it back. [ Laughter ] Before long, the deal was done. [ Laughter ]
It was only a few years ago, on St. Patrick's Day, when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate for my support of a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for a vote. I gave him my pledge, but I expressed skepticism that it would pass. But when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes that it needed and then some. I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how had he done it. He just patted me on the back and said, ""Luck of the Irish."" [ Laughter ]
Of course, luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy's legislative success; he knew that. A few years ago, his father-in-law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest Senators of all time. Without missing a beat, Teddy replied, ""What did Webster do?"" [ Laughter ]
But though it is Teddy's historic body of achievements that we will remember, it is his giving heart that we will miss. It was the friend and the colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, ""I'm sorry for your loss,"" or, ""I hope you feel better,"" or, ""What can I do to help?"" It was the boss so adored by his staff that over 500, spanning five decades, showed up for his 75th birthday party. It was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank-you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imagined that a U.S. Senator of such stature would take the time to think about somebody like them. I have one of those paintings in my private study off the Oval Office, a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who had just arrived in Washington and happened to admire it when Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office. That, by the way, is my second gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo. And it seems like everyone has one of those stories, the ones that often start with ""You wouldn't believe who called me today.""
Ted Kennedy was the father who looked not only after his own three children, but John's and Bobby's as well. He took them camping and taught them to sail. He laughed and danced with them at birthdays and weddings, cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy, and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him. Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down the aisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from Jackie that read: ""On you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to have been spared. We are all going to make it because you were always there with your love.""
Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted's love, he made it because of theirs, especially because the love and the life he found in Vicki. After so much loss and so much sorrow, it could not have been easy for Ted to risk his heart again. And that he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana. And she didn't just love him back. As Ted would often acknowledge, Vicki saved him. She gave him strength and purpose, joy and friendship, and stood by him always, especially in those last, hardest days.
We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way. We cannot know what God's plan is for us. What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose and with love and with joy. We can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them and treat others with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And we can strive at all costs to make a better world so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here, we know that we spent it well, that we made a difference, that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of others.
This is how Ted Kennedy lived. This is his legacy. He once said, as has already been mentioned, of his brother Bobby that he need not be idealized or enlarged in death because what he was in life, and I imagine he would say the same about himself. The greatest expectations were placed upon Ted Kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he became. We do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his name or his office. We weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who persevered through pain and tragedy, not for the sake of ambition or vanity, not for wealth or power, but only for the people and the country that he loved.
In the days after September 11th, Teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families of this State who lost a loved one in the attack. But he didn't stop there. He kept calling and checking up on them. He fought through redtape to get them assistance and grief counseling. He invited them sailing, played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible day came along. To one widow, he wrote the following: ""As you know so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss, but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved ones would want us to, and because there is still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us."" We carry on.
Ted Kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those that he has loved and lost. At last he is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the good that he did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image, the image of a man on a boat, white mane tousled, smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for whatever storms may come, carrying on toward some new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon. May God bless Ted Kennedy, and may he rest in eternal peace."
"July 17, 2008",Remarks at the Funeral Service for Former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-former-white-house-press-secretary-tony-snow,George W. Bush,eulogy,"Archbishop Wuerl; Father O'Connell; Mr. Vice President; members of the Cabinet and my administration; Members of Congress; distinguished guests; most importantly, the Snow family, Jill, Robbie, Kendall, Kristi, and Jim and other family members; former colleagues of Tony: Laura and I are privileged to join you today to pay our final respects to a cherished friend.
Tony Snow was a man of uncommon decency and compassion. He was a devoted husband, a proud and loving father, an adoring son, a beloved colleague, and a wonderful role model and friend.
In a life that was far too brief, he amassed a rare record of accomplishment. He applied his gifted mind to many fields: as a columnist, newspaper editor, TV anchor, radio host, and musician. He had the sometimes challenging distinction of working for two Presidents named Bush. As a speechwriter in my dad's administration, Tony tried to translate the President's policies into English. [ Laughter ] As a spokesman in my administration, Tony tried to translate my English into English. [ Laughter ]
Tony always gave me good and candid advice. He was a man of profound substance who loved ideas, held strong beliefs, and reveled in defending them. He took very seriously his duty to inform the public about what its Government was doing during historic times for our Nation.
In the White House briefing room, Tony worked to build a relationship of candor and trust with the press corps. On his first day at the podium, he told the gathered reporters this: ""One of the reasons I took this job is not only because I believe in the President, but because, believe it or not, I want to work with you."" Tony was the first working journalist to serve as the White House Press Secretary for nearly 30 years. He knew the job of a reporter was rigorous. He admired the profession and always treated it with respect. And the presence of so many members of the fourth estate here today attests to the admiration and respect that he earned.
Of course, Tony's adjustment from commentator to spokesman was not seamless. Ann Compton of ABC recently recalled that when you asked Tony a question, he would sometimes get going, and she would have to stop him and say, ""Tony, wait, I asked what the President thought."" [ Laughter ]
Tony brought a fierce and challenging intellect to his duties, and he displayed an engaging wit. When a reporter asked a rather labored question about Congress, Tony did not answer it. The persistent reporter pressed him: ""Are you going to just evade that question?"" With a smile, Tony quipped: ""No, I'm going to laugh at it."" [ Laughter ]
I believe the reason Tony was so good at his job is that he looked at the world in a joyful way. He was a proud patriot who believed in America's goodness and an optimist who knew America's possibilities. He believed strongly in the wisdom of the American people. And throughout his career, he took a special pride in being a vigorous and unapologetic defender of our men and women in uniform. He supported their missions, saw honor in their achievements, and found every possible opportunity to highlight their character and courage.
Tony Snow, the professional, is a hard act to follow. Tony Snow, the man, is simply irreplaceable. Everyone who worked with him quickly grew to love him. We will always remember his wry sense of humor and abundant goodness. We'll also remember he was just a lot of fun. After all, he played six different musical instruments and was a proud member of a band called Beats Working. He may be one of the few people in history to have jammed on the South Lawn of the White House and with Jethro Tull. [ Laughter ]
We remember Tony's thoughtfulness. No matter how busy he was, this was a man who put others first. He would go out of his way to ask about people's families. He would check in with friends whenever he heard they were ill. He'd reach out to others, sometimes strangers, who were struggling with cancer. Even when he was going through difficult chemotherapy sessions, he sent inspirational e-mails to a friend whose son was suffering from a serious illness.
We remember Tony's resilient spirit. When he received a second diagnosis of cancer, he did not turn to despair. He saw it as another challenge to tackle. He found comfort in the prayers he received from millions of Americans. As he told the graduates here at Catholic University last year: ""Never underestimate the power of other people's love and prayer. They have incredible power. It's as if I've been carried on the shoulders of an entire army, and they made me weightless.""
Most of all, we remember Tony's love of his family. There was no doubt for Tony Snow that his family was first. When Jill reached a milestone birthday, Tony had a huge celebration. He later said that he and Jill danced that night as if they were teenagers. He said he was the most fortunate man in the world to have shared love like that. So today, Jill, our hearts are with you. And we thank you for giving Tony such a special life.
For Robbie, Kendall, and Kristi, you are in our thoughts and prayers as well. We thank you for sharing your dad with us. He talked about you all the time. He wanted nothing more than your happiness and success. You know, I used to call Tony on the weekends to get his advice. And invariably, I found him with you on the soccer field or at a swim meet or helping with your homework. He loved you a lot. Today I hope you know that we loved him a lot too.
I know it's hard to make sense of today. It is impossible to fully comprehend why such a good and vital man was taken from us so soon. But these are the great mysteries of life, and Tony knew as well as anyone that they're not ours to unveil.
The day Tony was born was also the day that many of his fellow Catholics pay tribute to Saint Justin. Justin was also a gifted thinker and writer and a powerful witness for the Christian faith. Because of his beliefs, he suffered many times of trial, and in the year 165 A.D., he was arrested. Before he received a sentence of death, he was asked, ""If you are killed, do you suppose you will go to heaven?"" Justin replied, ""I do not suppose it, but I know and am fully persuaded of it.""
Tony Snow knew that as well. That brought him great peace. When talking about the struggle he waged so admirably, he said that no matter how bad times may sometimes seem: ""God doesn't promise tomorrow; He does promise eternity.""
And so today we send this man of faith and character and joy on his final journey. Tony Snow has left the city of Washington for the city of God. May he find eternal rest in the arms of his Savior. And may the Author of all creation watch over his family and all those who loved him, admired him, and will always cherish his memory."
"January 02, 2007",Eulogy at the National Funeral Service for Former President Gerald R. Ford,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-national-funeral-service-for-former-president-gerald-r-ford,George W. Bush,eulogy,"Mrs. Ford; the Ford family; distinguished guests, including our Presidents and First Ladies; and our fellow citizens:
We are here today to say goodbye to a great man. Gerald Ford was born and reared in the American heartland. He belonged to a generation that measured men by their honesty and their courage. He grew to manhood under the roof of a loving mother and father. And when times were tough, he took part-time jobs to help them out. In President Ford, the world saw the best of America, and America found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our Nation's history.
Long before he was known in Washington, Gerald Ford showed his character and his leadership. As a star football player for the University of Michigan, he came face to face with racial prejudice when Georgia Tech came to Ann Arbor for a football game. One of Michigan's best players was an African American student named Willis Ward. Georgia Tech said they would not take the field if a black man were allowed to play. Gerald Ford was furious at Georgia Tech for making the demand and for the University of Michigan for caving in. He agreed to play only after Willis Ward personally asked him to. The stand Gerald Ford took that day was never forgotten by his friend. And Gerald Ford never forgot that day either, and three decades later, he proudly supported the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act in the United States Congress.
Gerald Ford showed his character in the devotion to his family. On the day he became President, he told the Nation, ""I am indebted to no man and only to one woman—to my dear wife."" By then Betty Ford had a pretty good idea of what marriage to Gerald Ford involved. After all, their wedding had taken place less than 3 weeks before his first election to the United States Congress, and his idea of a honeymoon was driving to Ann Arbor with his bride so they could attend a brunch before the Michigan-Northwestern game the next day. [ Laughter ] And that was the beginning of a great marriage. The Fords would have four fine children. And Steve, Jack, Mike, and Susan know that, as proud as their dad was of being President, Gerald Ford was even prouder of the other titles he held: father and grandfather and great-grandfather.
Gerald Ford showed his character in the uniform of our country. When Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941, Gerald Ford was an attorney fresh out of Yale Law School, but when his Nation called, he did not hesitate. In early 1942 he volunteered for the Navy and, after receiving his commission, worked hard to get assigned to a ship headed into combat. Eventually his wish was granted, and Lieutenant Ford was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Monterey , which saw action in some of the biggest battles of the Pacific.
Gerald Ford showed his character in public office. As a young Congressman, he earned a reputation for an ability to get along with others without compromising his principles. He was greatly admired by his colleagues, and they trusted him a lot. And so when President Nixon needed to replace a Vice President who had resigned in scandal, he naturally turned to a man whose name was a synonym for integrity: Gerald R. Ford. And 8 months later, when he was elevated to the Presidency, it was because America needed him, not because he needed the office.
President Ford assumed office at a terrible time in our Nation's history. At home, America was divided by political turmoil and wracked by inflation. In Southeast Asia, Saigon fell just 9 months into his Presidency. Amid all the turmoil, Gerald Ford was a rock of stability. And when he put his hand on his family Bible to take the Presidential oath of office, he brought grace to a moment of great doubt.
In a short time, the gentleman from Grand Rapids proved that behind the affability was firm resolve. When a U.S. ship called the Mayaguez was seized by Cambodia, President Ford made the tough decision to send in the Marines, and all the crew members were rescued. He was criticized for signing the Helsinki accords, yet history has shown that document helped bring down the Soviet Union, as courageous men and women behind the Iron Curtain used it to demand their God-given liberties. Twice, assassins attempted to take the life of this good and decent man, yet he refused to curtail his public appearances. And when he thought that the Nation needed to put Watergate behind us, he made the tough and decent decision to pardon President Nixon, even though that decision probably cost him the Presidential election.
Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency when the Nation needed a leader of character and humility, and we found it in the man from Grand Rapids. President Ford's time in office was brief, but history will long remember the courage and common sense that helped restore trust in the workings of our democracy.
Laura and I had the honor of hosting the Ford family for Gerald Ford's 90th birthday. It's one of the highlights of our time in the White House. I will always cherish the memory of the last time I saw him this past year in California. He was still smiling, still counting himself lucky to have Betty at his side, and still displaying the optimism and generosity that made him one of America's most beloved leaders.
And so, on behalf of a grateful nation, we bid farewell to our 38th President. We thank the Almighty for Gerald Ford's life, and we ask for God's blessings on Gerald Ford and his family."
"February 07, 2006","Remarks at the Funeral Service for Coretta Scott King in Lithonia, Georgia",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-coretta-scott-king-lithonia-georgia,George W. Bush,eulogy,"To the King Family, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: We gather in God's house, in God's presence, to honor God's servant, Coretta Scott King. Her journey was long and only briefly with a hand to hold. But now she leans on everlasting arms. I've come today to offer the sympathy of our entire Nation at the passingof a woman who worked to make our Nation whole.
Americans knew her husband only as a young man. We knew Mrs. King in all the seasons of her life, and there was grace and beauty in every season. As a great movement of history took shape, her dignity was a daily rebuke to the pettiness and cruelty of segregation. When she wore a veil at 40 years old, her dignity revealed the deepest trust in God and His purposes. In decades of prominence, her dignity drew others to the unfinished work of justice. In all her years, Coretta Scott King showed that a person of conviction and strength could also be a beautiful soul. This kind and gentle woman became one of the most admired Americans of our time. She is rightly mourned, and she is deeply missed.
Some here today knew her as a girl and saw something very special long before a young preacher proposed. She once said, ""Before I was a King, I was a Scott."" And the Scotts were strong and righteous and brave in the face of wrong. Coretta eventually took on the duties of a pastor's wife and a calling that reached far beyond the doors of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.
In that calling, Dr. King's family was subjected to vicious words, threatening calls in the night, and a bombing at their house. Coretta had every right to count the cost and step back from the struggle. But she decided that her children needed more than a safe home; they needed an America that upheld their equality and wrote their rights into law. And because this young mother and father were not intimidated, millions of children they would never meet are now living in a better, more welcoming country.
In the critical hours of the civil rights movement, there were always men and women of conscience at the heart of the drama. They knew that old hatreds ran deep. They knew that nonviolence might be answered with violence. They knew that much established authority was against them. Yet they also knew that sheriffs and mayors and Governors were not ultimately in control of events, that a greater authority was interested and very much in charge. The God of Moses was not neutral about their captivity. The God of Isaiah and the prophets was still impatient with injustice. And they knew that the Son of God would never leave them or forsake them.
But some had to leave before their time, and Dr. King left behind a grieving widow and little children. Rarely has so much been asked of a pastor's wife, and rarely has so much been taken away. Years later, Mrs. King recalled, ""I would wake up in the morning, have my cry, then go in to them. The children saw me going forward.""
Martin Luther King, Jr., had preached that unmerited suffering could have redemptive power. Little did he know that this great truth would be proven in the life of the person he loved the most. Others could cause her sorrow, but no one could make her bitter. By going forward with a strong and forgiving heart, Coretta Scott King not only secured her husband's legacy, she built her own. Having loved a leader, she became a leader. And when she spoke, America listened closely, because her voice carried the wisdom and goodness of a life well lived.
In that life, Coretta Scott King knew danger; she knew injustice; she knew sudden and terrible grief. She also knew that her Redeemer lives. She trusted in the Name above every name. And today we trust that our sister Coretta is on the other shore—at peace, at rest, at home. May God bless you, and may God bless our country."
"September 07, 2005",Remarks at the Funeral Service for Chief Justice of the United States William H. Rehnquist,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-chief-justice-the-united-states-william-h-rehnquist,George W. Bush,eulogy,"Jim and Janet and Nancy; members of the Rehnquist family; colleagues of the Chief Justice:
This afternoon the people of the United States mourn the passing of the leader of a branch of the Government, the eight Justices of the Court pay final homage to their Chief and friend, and a loving family bids farewell to a kind and gentle soul.
William Hubbs Rehnquist accomplished many things in his good life and rose to high places. And we remember the integrity and the sense of duty that he brought to every task before him. That character was clear in the young man of 18 who signed up for the Army Air Corps during the Second World War. The Nation saw that character in his more than three decades of service on our highest Court. And the Nation saw it again last January the 20th, when the Chief Justice made his way onto the Inaugural platform. Many will never forget the sight of this man, weakened by illness, rise to his full height and say in a strong voice, ""Raise your right hand, Mr. President, and repeat after me.""
It was more than a half-century ago that Bill Rehnquist first came to the Supreme Court as a law clerk. As he would later recount the story, he made that trip from Milwaukee in the middle of the winter in an old blue Studebaker with no heater. He recalled that as he began the journey, he patted that car and thought, ""Don't let me down, baby.""
After a year-and-a-half in the Chambers of Justice Robert Jackson, Bill Rehnquist left DC and headed for Phoenix with an even greater love for the law and with something more, a beautiful fiancee named Natalie Cornell. She would share his walk in life for nearly 40 years. All who knew the Chief know how he cherished Nan and their time together and how much he missed his wife in the years without her.
In every chapter of his life, William Rehnquist stood apart for his powerful intellect and clear convictions. In a profession that values disciplined thought and persuasive ability, a talent like his gets noticed in a hurry. Still in his forties, he became the 100th Justice of the Supreme Court, and one of the youngest in modern times.
After he moved to the center chair, William Rehnquist led the Court for nearly two decades and earned a place among our greatest chief justices. He built consensus through openness and collegiality. He was a distinguished scholar of the Constitution and a superb administrator of the judicial conference. He understood the role of a judge and the place of courts in our constitutional system. He was prudent in exercising judicial power and firm in defending judicial independence.
On the bench and as a leader of the Federal courts, Chief Justice Rehnquist was always a calm and steady presence. In his thinking and in his bearing, he personified the ideal of fairness, and people could sense it. Inside the Court, no man could have been a finer steward of the institution, its customs, and its history.
As long as William Rehnquist was presiding, colleagues and advocates knew that the proceedings would be orderly, on time, businesslike, and occasionally humorous. Once during an oral argument, a lawyer criticized his opponent's position by saying, ""I doubt very much it will fool this Court."" The Chief Justice replied, ""Don't overestimate us."" [ Laughter ]
In his time on the Court, William Rehnquist served with 16 other justices, and by all accounts, each one of his colleagues regarded the man with respect and affection. Justice William Brennen once said to a visitor, ""I cannot begin to tell you... how fond all of us are of him personally.""
Throughout this city of government, people saw William Rehnquist in that same way. He carried himself with dignity but without pretense. Like Ronald Reagan, the President who elevated him to Chief Justice, he was kindly and decent, and there was not an ounce of self-importance about him. It is rare that—it is a rare man who can hold a prominent position in Washington, DC, for more than 30 years and leave behind only good feelings and admiration. That's what William Rehnquist did.
His law clerks knew him as a demanding boss who pressed them, as one said, to ""read carefully, write clearly, and to think hard."" But the clerks also became an extension of the Chief's family, joining him for walks around the Capitol, or for lunch or dinner, or games of tennis or charades. His clerks remember those times with fondness. And even more, they remember his vast store of knowledge and his daily example of clear thinking and character. To work beside William Rehnquist was to learn how a wise man looks at the law and how a good man looks at life.
The Chief Justice was devoted to his public duties but not consumed by them. He was a renaissance man, a man who adored his family, a man who always kept things in balance. He read works of history and wrote a few fine ones of his own. He knew how to paint, and he knew how to win at bridge and poker. He had a passion for the classics, for astronomy, and for college basketball. He enjoyed music, and having stood next to him during the national anthem, I can tell you the man loved to sing. [ Laughter ]
William Rehnquist often reminded young lawyers of the ancient insight that time is the most valuable thing a man can spend. He spoke with feeling about the need to choose wisely, doing your job well, and never forgetting the other important things that also take time: love for one another, being a good parent to a child, service to your community. He might have added, the importance of being a loving grandfather, because he was clearly that too.
The 16th Chief Justice of the United States was given 80 years of life. He filled those years with purpose, a gracious spirit, and faithful service to God and country to the very end. He now goes to his rest beside his beloved Nan. And William H. Rehnquist leaves behind the gratitude of our whole Nation. We're proud of our Chief Justice, and America honors his memory. May God bless him."
"June 11, 2004",Eulogy at the National Funeral Service for President Ronald Reagan,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-national-funeral-service-for-president-ronald-reagan,George W. Bush,eulogy,"Mrs. Reagan, Patti, Michael, and Ron; members of the Reagan family; distinguished guests, including our Presidents and First Ladies; Reverend Danforth; fellow citizens:
We lost Ronald Reagan only days ago, but we have missed him for a long time. We have missed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice, and the happy ending we had wished for him. It has been 10 years since he said his own farewell, yet it is still very sad and hard to let him go. Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us.
In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy. During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places, but there was only one person, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room.
America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderful journey and to that journey's end. Today our whole Nation grieves with you and your family.
When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California and we lay to rest our 40th President, a great American story will close. The second son of Nelle and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms, and carriages drawn by horse. If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois, of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library or running with his brother, Neil, along Rock River and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue. That town was the kind of place you remember where you prayed side by side with your neighbors, and if things were going wrong for them, you prayed for them and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you.
The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle, and uncertainty. And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm, and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things. The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago. As the lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector keeping an eye out for trouble. As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did. As an actor, he was the handsome, all-American good guy, which in his case required knowing his lines—and being himself.
Along the way, certain convictions were formed and fixed in the man. Ronald Reagan believed that everything happens for a reason and that we should strive to know and do the will of God. He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing. He believed that people were basically good and had the right to be free. He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of. He believed in the Golden Rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world but the hope of the world.
And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as he said, ""There's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse.""
Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known on occasion to change a man—but not this man. From Dixon to Des Moines to Hollywood to Sacramento to Washington, DC, all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow. Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience. His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as the columns of this cathedral.
There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies. The actor Robert Cummings recalled one occasion. ""I was sitting around the set with all these people, and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed. I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered someday becoming President?' He said, 'President of what?' 'President of the United States,' I said. And he said, 'What's the matter, don't you like my acting either?""' [ Laughter ]
The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country and a new following he did not seek or expect. He often began his speeches by saying, ""I'm going to talk about controversial things."" And then he spoke of communist rulers as slavemasters, of a Government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near. In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books and turned them into a broad, hopeful movement ready to govern.
As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's Governor, observers saw a star in the West, tanned, well-tailored, in command, and on his way. In the 1960s, his friend Bill Buckley wrote, ""Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a part of American history.""
Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980. He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century, as the convictions that shaped the President began to shape the times.
He came to office with great hopes for America and more than hopes. Like the President he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action. President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the rewards and spirit of enterprise. He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required. He was optimistic that liberty would thrive wherever it was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.
And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs. When he saw evil camped across the horizon, he called that evil by its name. There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code what the American President had dared to say. There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall that the first and hardest blow had been struck by President Ronald Reagan.
The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal tides and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage and triumph of free men, and we believe it all the more because we saw that courage in him.
As he showed what a President should be, he also showed us what a man should be. Ronald Reagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with a decency and attention to small kindnesses that also defined a good life. He was a courtly, gentle, and considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others.
Many people across the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand to family members on important occasions, to old friends dealing with sickness and loss, to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood. A boy once wrote to him requesting Federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom. [ Laughter ] The President replied that, ""Unfortunately, funds are dangerously low."" [ Laughter ] He continued, ""I'm sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are in an excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our Nation. Congratulations."" [ Laughter ]
See, our 40th President wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson. In the end, through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol of our country. We think of his steady stride, that tilt of the head and snap of the salute, the big-screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind.
We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a Scout saying the Pledge. We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousness of a man angered by injustice and frightened by nothing. We know, as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us, but with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine days are behind us, and that is worth our tears.
Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice, in a moment of violence and then in the years of departing light. He met both with courage and grace. In these trials, he showed how a man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end.
And where does that strength come from? Where is that courage learned? It is the faith of a boy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself. It is the faith of a man with a fearful illness who waited on the Lord to call him home.
Now death has done all that death can do. And as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with the joyful hope he shared. In his last years, he saw through a glass darkly. Now he sees his Savior face to face.
And we look for that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind, strong and sure and smiling again, and the sorrow of this parting gone forever.
May God bless Ronald Reagan and the country he loved."
"February 04, 2003","Remarks at a Memorial Service for the STS-107 Crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia in Houston, Texas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-the-sts-107-crew-the-space-shuttle-columbia-houston-texas,George W. Bush,eulogy,"Their mission was almost complete, and we lost them so close to home. The men and women of the Columbia had journeyed more than 6 million miles and were minutes away from arrival and reunion.
The loss was sudden and terrible, and for their families, the grief is heavy. Our Nation shares in your sorrow and in your pride, and today we remember not only one moment of tragedy but seven lives of great purpose and achievement.
To leave behind Earth and air and gravity is an ancient dream of humanity. For these seven, it was a dream fulfilled. Each of these astronauts had the daring and discipline required of their calling. Each of them knew that great endeavors are inseparable from great risks, and each of them accepted those risks willingly, even joyfully, in the cause of discovery.
Rick Husband was a boy of 4 when he first thought of being an astronaut. As a man, and having become an astronaut, he found it was even more important to love his family and serve his Lord. One of Rick's favorite hymns was ""How Great Thou Art,"" which offers these words of praise: ""I see the stars. I hear the mighty thunder. Thy power throughout the universe displayed.""
David Brown was first drawn to the stars as a little boy with a telescope in his backyard. He admired astronauts, but, as he said, ""I thought they were movie stars. I thought I was kind of a normal kid."" David grew up to be a physician, an aviator who could land on the deck of a carrier in the middle of the night, and a shuttle astronaut. His brother asked him several weeks ago what would happen if something went wrong on their mission. David replied, ""This program will go on.""
Michael Anderson always wanted to fly planes and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Air Force. Along the way, he became a role model, especially for his two daughters and for the many children he spoke to in schools. He said to them, ""Whatever you want to be in life, you're training for it now."" He also told his minister, ""If this thing doesn't come out right, don't worry about me. I'm just going on higher.""
Laurel Salton Clark was a physician and a flight surgeon who loved adventure, loved her work, loved her husband and her son. A friend who heard Laurel speaking to Mission Control said, ""There was a smile in her voice."" Laurel conducted some of the experiments as Columbia orbited the Earth and described seeing new life emerge from a tiny cocoon. ""Life,"" she said, ""continues in a lot of places, and life is a magical thing.""
None of our astronauts traveled a longer path to space than Kalpana Chawla. She left India as a student, but she would see the nation of her birth, all of it, from hundreds of miles above. When the sad news reached her hometown, an administrator at her high school recalled, ""She always said she wanted to reach the stars. She went there, and beyond."" Kalpana's native country mourns her today, and so does her adopted land.
Ilan Ramon also flew above his home, the land of Israel. He said, ""The quiet that envelops space makes the beauty even more powerful, and I only hope that the quiet can one day spread to my country."" Ilan was a patriot; the devoted son of a Holocaust survivor served his country in two wars. ""Ilan,"" said his wife, Rona, ""left us at his peak moment, in his favorite place, with people he loved.""
The Columbia's pilot was Commander Willie McCool, whom friends knew as the most steady and dependable of men. In Lubbock today they're thinking back to the Eagle Scout who became a distinguished naval officer and a fearless test pilot. One friend remembers Willie this way: ""He was blessed, and we were blessed to know him.""
Our whole Nation was blessed to have such men and women serving in our space program. Their loss is deeply felt, especially in this place, where so many of you called them friends. The people of NASA are being tested once again. In your grief, you are responding as your friends would have wished, with focus, professionalism, and unbroken faith in the mission of this agency.
Captain Brown was correct: America's space program will go on.
This cause of exploration and discovery is not an option we choose. It is a desire written in the human heart. We are that part of creation which seeks to understand all creation. We find the best among us, send them forth into unmapped darkness, and pray they will return. They go in peace for all mankind, and all mankind is in their debt.
Yet, some explorers do not return, and the loss settles unfairly on a few. The families here today shared in the courage of those they loved, but now they must face life and grief without them. The sorrow is lonely, but you are not alone. In time, you will find comfort and the grace to see you through. And in God's own time, we can pray that the day of your reunion will come.
And to the children who miss your mom or dad so much today, you need to know they love you and that love will always be with you. They were proud of you, and you can be proud of them for the rest of your life.
The final days of their own lives were spent looking down upon this Earth. And now, on every continent, in every land they could see, the names of these astronauts are known and remembered. They will always have an honored place in the memory of this country. And today I offer the respect and gratitude of the people of the United States.
May God bless you all."
"January 04, 2001","Remarks at a Memorial Service for Jack McAuliffe in Syracuse, New York",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-jack-mcauliffe-syracuse-new-york,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Millie; John, Joe, Tom, Terry; all the family and the grandchildren; reverend clergy. I want to thank the people who came with us today: our leader, Dick Gephardt, and his wife, Jane, and Senator Dodd and Congressman Coelho.
Hillary and I are here because we really liked Jack McAuliffe. And I know most people will say, ""Well, the President came because Terry did so much for him."" Truth is, I came for Joe. I thought we ought to have an Irish-Protestant support group here in this church. [ Laughter ]
One wonderful nun reached over to me during communion and said, ""Thank you so much for what you did for Ireland."" I said, ""I had to do it. It's about time we started getting along.""
I want to say just a few things. I spent quite a bit of time thinking about what I would say in my couple of minutes. Most of what I wanted to say has been said. But you know, when a great human being passes away, people search around in their minds for some part of the Scripture that captures that person. We talked about it a lot already today. Proverbs says, ""A happy heart doeth good like medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bone""—that God loves a cheerful giver. That's what Jack McAuliffe was. He knew it was more blessed to give than to receive. But nothing is more distasteful than someone who's out there doing good and wants you to know it every minute of the day.
Jack McAuliffe was a cheerful giver. Whether it was in risking his life in the Pacific or leading campaigns here to build a church for his neighbors or schools for the kids or cheering and giving to Notre Dame or the Democratic Party or spending time imparting all the lessons to his children that you heard about or just buying a round at the local bar, he was a cheerful giver.
And every time I was around him, I felt better. And so did you, and that's why you're here today. He gave more to us than any of us outside his family gave to him. And we showed up to say, ""You gave us a lesson in life. We loved you for it, and we're grateful.""
I have to say a little something about his ties to the Democratic Party. He was the county Democratic treasurer here for decades. And he started Terry out as a political fundraiser when he was 6 years old. I've heard this story—no matter how many times, I never get tired of it.
When Terry was 6, on the night of the Onondaga County Democratic dinner, his dad sat him down at a card table outside the ballroom at the Hotel Syracuse and said, ""Don't let anybody in who hasn't paid."" [ Laughter ] Terry immediately found his true calling in life. [ Laughter ] And you know, when he got up here, the first words out of his mouth were that his Republican brother paid. [ Laughter ] So thanks, Jack, you did good.
I'll always be grateful because Jack showed me something about going through life and staying young by never losing your enthusiasm. You know, he didn't take—he was very proud of Terry's role in politics, but he didn't think it meant that he was now too good to do the basic work of politics. He was out there putting up yard signs for Hillary in this campaign when he was 83 years old. And I think he was pretty pleased at the way things came out.
I also like the fact that he didn't lose his spirit when it didn't all work the way he thought it should. I mean, he thought Notre Dame should never lose, and he had what in this year turned out to be a bizarre idea: He thought all votes should actually be counted. [ Laughter ] But he just kept chugging along, you know? And he made me even feel better about all of that.
Terry, of all the things you've done for me, turns out none of them was better than the chance you gave me to be your father's friend. His memory will always bring a smile to the face of all of us who knew him, and we'll always miss him. But I rejoice in the fact that Jack, the cheerful giver, is in his rightful place, where the road is always rising and the wind is always at his back, and he is always in the hollow of God's hand. Thank you, Jack."
"December 16, 2000",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Charles F.C. Ruff,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-charles-fc-ruff,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Sue, Christy, Carin, Maggie, other family and friends. I was sitting in this service listening to Chuck's family members, friends, partner speak about him, and I was thinking he'd be fairly embarrassed by all these attempts to canonize him. So they put one client on the program. [ Laughter ]
I have been on the receiving end of all this wisdom you have been celebrating, and he always told me what he thought, especially when I did not want to hear it.
Chuck Ruff became the White House Counsel at an unusual point in history, when the White House was in the hands of the Democratic Party and the Congress was in the hands of a particular wing of the Republican Party, and a lot of the work of the White House Counsel was generated by the attempts of Congress to turn every political difference into a legal issue.
And Chuck had to be calm in the face of all of it: Attempts to prove that our policy on climate change, for example, was actually a secret socialist plot to destroy the free enterprise system; serious questions from a person who believed that a good form of criminal investigation was shooting bullets into a watermelon in his backyard. And Chuck never lost his cool, never lost his temper, and never let me entirely lose my sense of humor about what often was a patently absurd situation.
And then there were the serious issues beneath all the rancor and back-and-forth. And every single day—every single day—I was so profoundly grateful that my Counsel was so strong and wise and good and that he believed so profoundly in our Constitution and rule of law.
As others have said, he never sought the spotlight, but when the moment came, he certainly shined. Millions of Americans saw him at work, mind and spirit. He cared about justice. He taught it; he shared it; and he lived it. His whole life was about doing good and doing right.
Others have commented on his propensity for doing two things at once. I liked that. He once said that he finally understood that he had been picked as the White House Counsel because he was the only person who was not distracted by my doing crossword puzzles when we reviewed our latest strategy in dealing with the congressional requests.
He was famous in the West Wing for watching football and listening to opera at the same time. But really, that captures the best of who he was, a competitor with passion, equal parts grace and guts, someone determined to make the most of every moment.
For those of us who knew and loved him, Chuck Ruff may have been in a wheelchair, but he had more moves than Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan, and when he heated up, he could hit any ball further than Tiger Woods, because he was so intensely committed to doing right and doing good.
I also would like to say a special word of appreciation, in front of his family and friends, for the fact that, in spite of all of the highprofile things Chuck did as the White House Counsel, one of the things that I most appreciated was that he was always there for the people in the White House, especially for the young people. He was always there with a calming and reassuring word, even in the craziest of times. He could always help people stop and take a breath, listen a little better, think a little harder, gather up their energies, and go on. In a town so often contentious, it was truly amazing to be reminded that you can be civil and effective at the same time.
I'd also like to thank him publicly for how much he loved the District of Columbia and how strongly he supported our administration's efforts to be a good neighbor and a good partner. Who can forget that he began his closing statement last year in the well of the Senate: ""My name is Charles Ruff. I'm from the District of Columbia. And we don't have a vote in the Congress of the United States.""
I wish, in a way, this platform today in this house of God could be shared by every person in the White House who loved him. And I wish so much that every person out there on the streets of Washington, DC, whom he loved could know just a portion of what he labored to do for them. The reason I was proud to have him as my White House Counsel is that he was not a power lawyer; he was a powerful lawyer for people who had no power.
No matter what he was asked to do, he did it with grace and honor, as if that alone was what God put him on Earth to do. And for that I am profoundly grateful.
Chuck Ruff left us far too soon. But you can hear in the words and see in the voice of every person who has spoken today that he is still here. I hope he thinks we did all right by him today. I hope he is pleased by this vast assemblage of people, because he certainly always did more than all right by all of us."
"October 20, 2000","Remarks at a Memorial Service for Governor Mel Carnahan in Jefferson City, Missouri",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-governor-mel-carnahan-jefferson-city-missouri,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Jean, Robin, Tom, Russ, Debra, to all the Carnahan family and the extended Carnahan family; to the Sifford family; and Governor and Mrs. Wilson; Senator Daschle and Congressman Gephardt and all the Members of Congress who are here and the Governors. I think I can speak for Hillary and the Vice President and Tipper when I say that we are profoundly honored to be here, and we come out of respect for the work that Mel Carnahan did for the people of Missouri, the example he set for the Nation, and the genuine friendship he showed to us.
I loved the guy. And anybody who thinks he was dull never looked him straight in the eye, because he had steel and passion and fire. And I think he rather enjoyed being underestimated by people who disagreed with him.
I hope his fellow citizens of this ""Show Me"" State will be gratified by what is an absolutely stunning representation here in this crowd of his fellow Governors, United States Senators, United States Representatives from all across this great land. They came here because he in some way touched them or because he inspired them or because, like me, they were just crazy about him.
He was a leader in the very best way. Yes, he was a leader like Harry Truman: He spoke the plain truth and thought there was no greater calling than public service and really believed if you appealed to the best in people, most of the time that's exactly what you'd get.
In a time when it's fashionable for people in public life to sort of complain about the difficulties of it, he was frank to say that he liked politics and public service. Indeed, he loved it. He didn't understand why some people thought it was a sacrifice and a pain. For him, it was a calling, a calling to work with people, and I saw it personally.
I don't know how many times either the Vice President or I came to Missouri because this was the leading State in the country in moving people from welfare to work. He believed that the dignity of a job and the ability to work and support one's children was the best form of social welfare. And he thought we could do it right. And we came here at least three times—I did—to try to point the way to the rest of the country to look and see what was going on here and know we could do it all around America.
I, too, remember those awful floods where he led by example, scrambling up levies to help bear the burden of sandbagging. When his critics warned him not to raise taxes for education because he could lose his job, he decided Missouri's kids were worth the risk. And those of us who followed him loved him even more.
And when some outside interests tried to pass a concealed weapon law in Missouri, he really took his career in his hands. Mel and Robin and the entire family got a lot of people involved, even got Hillary involved, everybody they could scrounge up to help them to stand up and turn a tide that, I have to confess, I didn't think they could turn.
For the Carnahans, politics was a noble family affair. They have given so much of them, each in their own way. And they've done it with dignity, grace, and generosity of spirit. For all the young people out here wondering whether politics is or is not compatible with a good, loving family, I say, look at the Carnahans. You can deal with the rough and tumble. If there's enough love, you will endure and flourish.
Less than a week ago, our friend Mel was hard at work in what turned out to be his last campaign. I thought when we marched behind the casket today and the magnificent horse with the boot turned backwards in the stirrups, that in a way it was fitting that our friend Mel died in the saddle with his boots on, fighting for the causes he championed and the people of Missouri whom he loved so much and served so well.
We honor that. And we honor the life of his son and of Chris Sifford. We honor the fact that Randy was always ready to help and support his father. We honor the fact that Chris was an idealist who gave so much of his life to the public service that Mel did. We honor the fact that they believed in him, and in turn, he made them believe in themselves and their ability to make a difference.
I like the fact that Mel Carnahan was the only politician that I have known who was actually not ashamed to say that one of his political role models was Adlai Stevenson. It didn't matter to him that Stevenson had holes in his shoes, lost the Presidency twice, and was considered by most people to be an impractical egghead. The main thing was, Stevenson was an elegant, good man who thought politics was a noble endeavor. And he said it better than just about anybody ever has.
I will never forget coming to a rally in southwest Missouri in early 1992, when Mel was involved in a very tough primary for Governor that he wasn't necessarily favored to win, and I was running for President, polling a distant fifth in New Hampshire. Only my mother thought I could win. But Mel Carnahan came to that rally in southwest Missouri and came out for me. He had absolutely nothing to gain by it—nothing. He did it just because he thought it was right. And for 8 years, he has been my friend and my partner.
In so many ways, he was a magnificent Governor. I suspect only those who have worked with him across a wide range of issues can know just how good he was. The last thing we did here together, Jean, was talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights and to eat a little barbecue. Mel made sure we went in the kitchen and shook hands with the people there. He never let me forget that just because I wasn't running again, I was still a public servant.
I am grateful—grateful—that I knew Mel Carnahan. I am grateful that we had the chance to work together. He left us too early, but he had a great ride. He had a wonderful wife, devoted children, people who believed in public service. Robin worked in our administration for a while, and I'm grateful for that. And I think we should remember him with this admonition of Saint Paul to the Galatians: ""While we have time, let us do good.""
I spoke the other day to a congregation of bishops of the Church of God in Christ, and I made the mistake of saying I was glad to be with them because, unlike me, they weren't term-limited. And the head bishop stood up and said, ""Mr. President, we are all term-limited.""
So if he were here—and in a way, he is— he would say, ""Okay, so I had a lot more I wanted to do, but I had a good ride. And it's not so bad being up there. The boys are good company, and I'm looking down on you. You know what to do. While you have time, do good.""
We'll miss you, Mel. We'll try to take up the slack, but we'll not have another one like you. God bless you, and Godspeed."
"July 25, 2000","Remarks at a Memorial Service for Diane Blair in Fayetteville, Arkansas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-diane-blair-fayetteville-arkansas,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"I think my friend would get a big kick out of knowing today that I am virtually at a loss for words. [ Laughter ] Every friendship has a chronology. Ours started in 1972 when I came up here to Fayetteville to see Diane because she was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. And we two comprised, along with Jim, some 50 percent of the white Arkansans who wanted to vote for George McGovern. [ Laughter ]
So we're drinking a cup of coffee or drinking a Coke or something at the union, and I'd met this woman like 10 minutes ago, and I was supposed to be talking politics with her, and all of a sudden, I started talking about Hillary, and I was talking about how much she had reminded me of Hillary. And all of a sudden, I felt that, somehow, she had totally captured me, and in some fundamental way, I would somehow belong to her for the rest of my life. [ Laughter ] And that's exactly what happened.
And in 1973 when I came home to Arkansas, and then Hillary came here, and I made sure they got together, and Diane and Jim and I— we'd meet her, one of us—we weren't married then, and it's been kind of the most interesting thing in my friendship life that Hillary and I always considered Diane and Jim our best ""couple friend."" But we were both privileged to have individual friendships with both of them, and it has been a true blessing.
It does tickle me that she worked in all my campaigns, and after Jim made her a rich lady, she still lived in that lousy apartment in Little Rock in '92—[ laughter ]—still working the campaign. [ Laughter ] It tickles me that when I married them in 1979—that's one way a Governor has more power than a President; I can't do that anymore—[ laughter ]—they wanted me to wear a top hat, tails. I even had a cane. And I never get tired of looking at that wedding picture. It's in the program.
Then, this was not a woman to let you wallow in self-pity. In 1980 I became the youngest former Governor in the history of America. [ Laughter ] So after giving me a couple of months to lick my wounds and feel sorry for myself, she made me show up at her political science class to explain how I got my brains beat out. [ Laughter ]
So many times over the last several years, she gave me a home away from home, and then since we've been in the White House, as you heard Hillary say, even in the Governor's mansion, we tried to give them the same.
It was just a little over 5 months ago, and probably 2 or 3 days before we learned that Diane was ill, that Jim came up and spent 3 nights—3 days and 3 nights—in Washington, and we were thinking about all the trips that we would take together when, finally, Hillary and I were liberated from our present responsibilities.
It doesn't take long to live a life. And I guess what I would like to say today is that somehow, I felt about her as I have rarely felt about any human being, that she had this peculiar blend. She was beautiful and good. She was serious and funny. She was completely ambitious to do good and be good but fundamentally selfless.
Sometime in our mid-thirties when Hillary and I were living in the Governor's mansion, we woke up one day and realized we might not live forever and that something could happen to us, and we actually made out a will. And I called Diane and Jim and said, ""You know, we're making out this will. Would you raise Chelsea if anything happens to us?""
Thankfully, we were able to watch our children grow up together. Diane had great kids and great stepchildren. Bill and Missy both work for Hillary and me now, and we're very grateful for that.
There are just three other points I would like to make. Diane had an interesting life— came to Arkansas because she married Hugh Kincaid, and she stayed. Jim Blair would be the first person to tell you she made a lot better man out of him than he was before he married her. [ Laughter ] And most of us would tell you that she somehow made better people of us as well.
But I want to say this, because somebody needs to. I've never seen a more beautiful, complete expression of love in my life than you, Jim, when you fought to save her, and you took care of her when you realized you couldn't.
The second thing I want to tell you is Diane Blair lived to the very end. I mean, really lived. She and I were still doing the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle together. All these times, you know, we got all these—Hillary and I would get good publicity for flying down here to see Diane, and people wanted to know what we did. We sat on a couch, and we worked the crossword puzzle. And she was exceedingly jealous of me because I would get the copy 3 or 4 days before Sunday, and she got it a couple days later. [ Laughter ]
So I used to taunt her. I would do it—I would do the crossword puzzle, and I was faithful in doing it. Once she got sick, I did it the first day I got it. I would send it to her, and I would taunt her, because she prided herself so much in being too noble to sneak and see whether I had gotten the answer right if she was having trouble. [ Laughter ]
The second thing I want you to know is, she was still writing me letters to the end. ""Dear President Bill: You should give a farewell address. Only a few Presidents have. You should do it. And here is exactly what you should say."" [ Laughter ]
I was looking at all of these pictures up here. And I thought about how many times over the years I would just—we'd be up at the lake doing something, just grungy as we could be, all four of us, and Diane would turn a certain way, and I would think: My God, she's beautiful— in a totally unique way. And I was seeing all these pictures, thinking about that again.
The last time Hillary and I saw her, I think it was the day before she essentially lost consciousness. And she was there with her little grandchildren on the bed, and she had lost all her hair, and she wasn't going to the trouble to wear a wig anymore. But her eyes were still burning, and she was so beautiful.
And the last thing she ever said was the thing I'd like to say to you. Hillary and Chelsea and I were standing there, and Hillary and I were holding her hands, and she said, ""Before I go""— because we were leaving; we had to leave— she didn't say before you go, she said, ""Before I go, I want to tell you: Remember."" And Hillary said, ""Remember what, Diane?"" And she smiled and said, ""Just remember."" So that's what I say to you. And every dark and difficult moment of your life, whenever you need to remember something profoundly good, get a little more energy to redouble your efforts, feel less sorry for yourself, be more grateful, just remember.
Thank you."
"May 25, 2000","Remarks at a Memorial Service for Casey Shearer in Providence, Rhode Island",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-casey-shearer-providence-rhode-island,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"The President. Derek, Ruth, Anthony, Julia, Marva, Allyson, all of the family and friends, I want you to know why we're here today. Over 30 years ago, I lived with Casey's Uncle Strobe, and through him I met Casey's Aunt Brooke. And they were in love, and so I then had to meet Derek and Cody and Marva and Skip. And then I introduced them to Hillary. And then Derek introduced all of us to Ruth. And the rest is history.
What I want to say to all of you is, when we were young, we were to each other what Casey has been to you. And I think I can say for all of us, listening to you today has been overwhelming and wonderful. And all I can hope is that you will hold on to it for the rest of your lives.
But we have a few memories, too.
[ At this point, the First Lady made brief remarks. ]
The President. His classmates might be interested to know that when I ran for President first in 1992, Casey actually tried to tutor me in rap music. [ Laughter ] You know, I would do this whole shtick. I played on Arsenio Hall's show, and I was trying to show that I was in tune with younger voters. I knew nothing about rap music. [ Laughter ] I knew nothing about the music of the eighties. I went to work and missed it all. Casey was horrified that I was going to embarrass myself on national television and blow the election. [ Laughter ]
I also remember, after we went to the White House, Casey and his family, we went to a Baltimore Orioles game together. And I actually thought I knew something about baseball until he offered the play-by-play. [ Laughter ] So I remember that.
[ The First Lady made brief remarks. ]
The President. Now, I come here today and find out that he gave a great gift to our Embassy in Italy with that—[ laughter ]. You know, even though I just have a few months left to serve, I still have some measure of influence, and I think I'll have a plaque put up at that pool. [ Laughter ]
Let me say to all of you just one last thing. Growing older has its joys. But one of the great burdens is the pain and mystery of losing children—the ones you know and the ones you don't. And I don't know any more about it today than I did when I was your age, but I know a little more about life. It's such a short time— 21 years, 22.
But a few days ago, I went to Chicago to an event, and after it was over I went with my friends there to the Field Museum, where Hillary spent a lot of time as a kid. Now, at the Field Museum now, they have this 67-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex named Sue, after the woman who found her on a South Dakota farm. I liked old Sue. And I thought to myself, we're all just passing through. I mean, she was here 67 million years ago.
And what I would like to say to you is that, whether you live for 20 years or 50 or 80 or 100, it doesn't take long to live a life. And Mr. Wordsworth was right, the last best portions of it are the little unremembered acts of kindness and love. Casey Shearer had a great life.
Thank you."
"April 27, 2000","Remarks at a Memorial Service for Daisy Bates in Little Rock, Arkansas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-daisy-bates-little-rock-arkansas,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, for those wonderful words and for doing a wonderful job in Washington. Governor, Mayor, Senator Lincoln, Representatives Snyder and Berry and Hutchinson, Lieutenant Governor Rockefeller, and Attorney General Pryor and Senator Pryor, we're glad to see you here today. Thank you.
To Larry Ross and all of the committee; and Carlotta, thank you for your words; and Ernie, Minnijean, Jeff, and Elizabeth, thank you for being here. I thank all the people who provided our magnificent music, and I thank Janis and Diane and my longtime friend John Walker for what they had to say about Daisy. And I want to thank the Gaston and Bates families for inviting me here today. I've had a good time. [ Laughter ] And I'm glad I came. And I think Daisy's getting a good kick out of us making such a fuss about her today. [ Laughter ]
On the day of Daisy's funeral, I would like to have been here, but I was in Washington because that was the day long assigned to present the Congressional Gold Medal to her Little Rock Nine. I remember the last time I saw her was here, in 1997, on the day we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the integration of Little Rock Central High. And though her body was weaker and her voice was gone, she was still plainly happy to be there as the Governor and the mayor and I held open the doors for the students who were once kept out by the law, to walk in to the cheers of their fellow citizens—thanks to her.
I think that my old friend Reverend Young said about all that needed to be said about— [ laughter ]—about nearly everything. I am still in one piece, although it's a slightly grayer— [ laughter ]—jagged, more beaten up piece. But Reverend Young, I just figured if all of you were doing better, I could sure get by. And I'm glad to be here with you.
I was trying to think—you know, one thing I'd like to say to you is that there is always a danger when somebody does something that is really great that defines his or her life, that somehow you miss everything else. You know, we could put flowers at the shrine of what Daisy Bates did, at Little Rock Central High School, and for those nine young people, from now until the end of this country, and we never could do enough to say thank you.
But what I'd like to say to you at the end of this very moving and long and inspiring program is that I really liked Daisy Bates. I liked her for who she was. I liked her because she was a brave woman who fought the civil rights battle. But I liked her also because she was a brave woman who kept her spirits up and found joy in life as her body began to fail, who learned to speak through her eyes when her voice would no longer make a sound, and who never lost the ability to laugh.
I never will forget when I was wheeling Daisy through the Civil Rights Memorial at Memphis, when they put up the section on Little Rock Central High School, and they had the wonderful statue to her on one side and a pretty good likeness of Governor Faubus on the other side. [ Laughter ] So I wheeled Daisy in, you know, and then she was looking at herself, and I said, ""You look pretty good, Daisy."" She said, ""Yeah."" And I said, ""Old Orval looks pretty good, too, doesn't he?"" And she said, ""Yeah, he does."" [ Laughter ] She was laughing about it.
She always—she had a dignity that comes from having lived a life well and a peace of mind that comes from faith and strength that allows you to let go of those things that time is going to take away sooner or later from all of us, anyway. But not very many people can do that. A lot of people would have been feeling sorry for themselves, saying, ""Well, after I did all this stuff in my life, why doesn't my body work anymore?""
I liked Daisy Bates not only because of what she did at Little Rock but because of the way she lived right to the end. And when she lost things that are painful for any person to lose, somehow what was left became more pure, more strong, almost like a diamond that was chipped away and formed and shines more brightly. And I am grateful for that.
You know, I'm also grateful for the fact that she overcame the adversities of her childhood. I was glad John Walker said what he did. This was an orphan child who found her way to a great truth. She was, in addition to what the film said about her, the only woman pilot in the Arkansas Civil Air Patrol in World War II and the only woman who spoke on that magnificent day at The Mall in August of 1963 when Martin Luther King gave his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
She endured emotional and physical attacks, ostracism, violence, and harassment. Her newspaper was boycotted by local businesses who closed the door of it for three decades, because they wanted neither her nor it to speak the truth to their deaf ears. In spite of it all, maybe because of it all, Daisy Bates continued to fight the good fight.
There's something else I think is worth saying. When you come to the end of a person's life and an end of an era, and you look at all these little children here and you look at this beautiful choir back behind us, there is a certain tendency to believe that, oh, this is a great country with a great history, and somehow this was all inevitable it was going to turn out this way. That is not true. That is not true. And I want the young people to know that it is not true.
Daisy Bates did not know she was going to win. But she fought anyway. That's where the real courage is. If you know you're going to win in the end, it doesn't take a lot of courage to fight. And the pain of the wounds is not so great if you know you're going to win anyway.
Listen to this. She said recently, ""When we took on segregation in the Little Rock schools, I don't think we had any big idea we were going to win it, but they were going to know they had a fight."" [ Laughter ] In the words of a woman she knew and admired, Eleanor Roosevelt, she believed, and I quote, that, ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."" [ Laughter ] Well, she never gave her consent, and she never gave her consent later when she began to break physically.
During the whole time I was honored to be your Governor here, I was inspired by her confidence and spurred by her conscience. I love what she said about our State, because she loved Arkansas, warts and all. Listen to this. She said, ""Arkansas is the home of my birth, my growth, my identity as a woman in this world. It has claimed me from birth, and I have claimed it for life.""
Daisy is now in a place where earthly rewards don't mean all that much and certainly aren't needed. But we who are still here, we need our earthly reminders of the values she lived and fought for, the work she did, and the work still to be done. So today, in honor of Daisy Bates, I want to make two announcements.
First, I have asked that her home at 1207 West 28th be approved as a national historic landmark as soon as possible. [ Applause ] Thank you. Second, on behalf of Hillary and myself, I am glad to designate Little Rock Central High School an official project of the White House Millennium Council's Save America's Treasures program, to make it eligible for funds that we're putting out across this country to help to renovate, restore, and enshrine the great places in our history. [ Applause ] Thank you.
I close with this. Little Rock Central High School embodies for me, in these lives of the children behind me and the rich history it has, the motto that Hillary and I had for celebrating this year 2000, that we would honor the past and imagine the future. So that's the last thing I want to leave with you.
I don't know if I can remember the Governor's exact words—you know he's a better preacher than I am. [ Laughter ] But I thought it was great when he—I can't remember—he said, ""There's some people that, because of face or place, race or grace, think they're better than other people."" That was really good; I wish I'd thought of that. [ Laughter ] Wasn't that good? [ Applause ] That was really good.
But I will just leave you with this. If you really want to honor Daisy Bates and you want to remember the fire in her eyes, even as she had to sit down instead of stand up, you need to think about the future. Even in this most modern of worlds, where we're imagining how wonderful it will be when every one of our kids is connected to the Internet, and when we're about to unlock the mysteries of the humane genome, and in a few years we'll know what's in those black holes in outer space, the biggest problem we got in this whole world today is the oldest problem of humankind, which we learned about in our own way in Little Rock: People are still scared of people who are different from them.
And when they are—and everybody's scared of something. [ Laughter ] And some people think that it's scary just getting up every day, and everybody's scared of something. So a lot of people have always thought, throughout all of human history, that the only way they can deal with their fears is to find somebody different from them they can look down on and think, ""At least I am not that."" And there's not a person in this room hadn't done that—not a one. ""I may be bad; at least I'm not a hypocrite."" [ Laughter ] ""I may be a thief; at least I'm not cheap."" [ Laughter ] ""I may be this; at least I'm not that.""
But the biggest demon is in race and religion. All over the world today, it is still eating people alive. So we want to celebrate the modern world and all the wonders it's bringing, and we're being dragged down because we still can't let go of what every one of us in the room at least should have learned better than to do at Little Rock.
So I ask you to think about that. If God came down to me today and said, ""I'm sorry, you've survived a lot, but I'm not going to let you finish your term. You're headed out of here today, and I'll give you one wish. I'm not a genie; you can't have three—one""—[ laughter ]— I would not wish for continued prosperity. I would not wish for some new weapon system to protect us forever. I would wish that somehow we would find it in our hearts to be one America and to lead the world toward that.
So I say this. If you liked and admired Daisy Bates and you really want to do something to memorialize her, promise yourself you will spend the rest of your life in every way you can bringing us closer to that wonderful idea.
Thank you, and God bless you."
"February 04, 2000",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Bob Squier,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-bob-squier,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Prudy; to the members of your family; to all of us who were friends of Bob Squier. The Scripture summons us, ""Neglect not the gift that is in thee."" Today we celebrate a man who did not neglect his gift but instead shared it.
We have heard it in the stories of his sons, his partner, his friends, and they have caused us all to flood our minds and hearts with memories of Bob Squier's passion for life, for his family, his work, for politics. Vice President Gore and I, in particular, are the beneficiaries of that passion and of his abundant American optimism.
As has already been said, no matter how dark the night, Bob was always sure the Sun would come up in the morning, and if it didn't, he would still find a way to get a tan. [ Laughter ] This sort of optimism was in rather short supply right after the elections in 1994, and most people thought that there were better investments in American politics than the reelection of Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Not Bob Squier. He saw it as sort of a minor challenge. He was there for us, and but for him, we might not be here today. There is something to be said for boundless optimism.
I think we ought to acknowledge, as has already been done, that this was a man whose passion for politics was part of a kaleidoscopic view of life and a wide range of interests. In addition to his documentaries about our great authors, he was also a pioneer in music television: one of the youngest producers of the Boston Pops on PBS, the executive producer of the first live global satellite TV show featuring the Beatles. He even talked about working years ago with the Rolling Stones, which probably makes him the only person in his line of work in the entire world who could say that he worked with everyone from Keith Richards to Ann Richards. [ Laughter ]
Bob Squier was many things. They have all been described today: a brilliant strategist, incisive commentator, trusted adviser, loyal friend. Above all, though, I think he was a storyteller. He knew how to tell a story, and he knew how to see the story that was being told right before our eyes.
He was very proud of his award-winning documentaries. He saw in the lives of Faulkner, Melville, Hemingway, and Fitzgerald, and in their work, the story of America, just as surely as he saw it in the lives and campaigns of all of us in this hallowed cathedral today with whom he worked. He dug deep into their lives to tell us the story.
For all the politicians here who ever agonized through one more take of a television ad, one more instruction about how this townhall meeting had to be dealt with, we're not surprised at the details of his attention to his documentaries. He took F. Scott Fitzgerald's only daughter back to places she knew as a child and then interviewed her about her father. He took Robert Penn Warren to Shiloh to talk about Melville's Civil War poem about that battle. He interviewed Hemingway's son Jack as he cast flies in an Idaho trout stream. He even went to Havana and filmed in a boat piloted by Hemingway's former captain, who provided the inspiration for ""The Old Man and the Sea.""
That's the way he did his politics. It was never about the manipulation of words and images to put something over on the American people. It was always about finding the story and trusting the people to get it right.
He told our story: a couple of farmers in a field holding a sign that said ""Hope""; a widow placing a flag on a veteran's grave on a lonely hillside; a worker filled with the pride that comes from the dignity of a job; and as has been mentioned, the light in little Emma's eyes. He used them all to tell our story. Nobody did it better. He made policy understandable, politics exciting, and politicians human. He made the camera disappear.
Bob worked in a profession with one of the shortest half-lives in the world. But to paraphrase one of his heroes, William Faulkner, here in Washington he did not just endure; he prevailed, for over 30 years, not just by putting a notch in the campaign victory belt but putting into office candidates he knew shared his convictions and would fight his fights.
I have to say this on behalf of all of the elected and former elected officials here. There is one thing we all especially found endearing about Bob Squier. He actually liked politicians. [ Laughter ] And he wasn't ashamed to admit it, even in this age when sort of sanctimonious disapproval of us is the only politically correct position. He saw people in politics as basically good people who struggled to reconcile personal conviction and popular opinion into a combined force that would lift our Nation to higher grounds.
Bob Squier's work lives on through all of us he lifted, through countless others he mentored and trained along the way. And so, the story of this great storyteller's life in a sense is still being written and will be for a long time to come.
In years to come, students of American politics will study Bob Squier's campaigns, Bob Squier's commercials, Bob Squier's commentaries. Students of our literature will study Bob Squier's documentary films. Those of us who shared this all-too-brief earthly journey with him, we'll be grateful for all that. But I suspect even more, we'll remember a dashing and handsome man with a killer smile, an acid wit, and goodness at the core, a goodness that made even his adversaries like him.
We'll remember that behind the smile visible in his eyes was a steel will, a strong spirit, and a great heart that made our Nation better, because it gave him the strength to nurture the gift that was in him and to share it with us.
Well, Bob, we're giving you a good sendoff today, but not nearly as good as what you gave us. The last campaign is over. The polls have closed. The votes are counted. And you won— big time. Now you're in a place with no talk shows and no term limits. But your spirit will soar forever. Godspeed."
"January 10, 2000","Remarks at Funeral Services for Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., in Annapolis, Maryland",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-funeral-services-for-elmo-r-zumwalt-jr-annapolis-maryland,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Mouza, Ann, Mouzetta, Jim, James, Saralee, all the members of this wonderful family, and in the words of Ambassador Lader, this extended family: Hillary and I are honored to be here today to join in praising, remembering, and cherishing the life of a man who was our friend and whose love for his family, his Nation, and his Navy were as deep as the oceans he sailed.
Listening to Phil Lader talk about how Bud and Mouza first met brought back so many old memories to me and to those of us who had the privilege to listen to Bud Zumwalt tell that story. I became convinced that it was the reverse of the fish story, that every time he's told it, she said yes in a shorter and shorter amount of time. [ Laughter ]
The last time I was in this magnificent chapel was to say goodbye to another great admiral of the 20th century, Arleigh Burke. When our historians look back on the century we have just left, they may well record that Arleigh Burke was the spirit of the United States Navy; they will certainly recall that Bud Zumwalt was its conscience.
As much as any other leader in our entire history, Americans could always count on Bud Zumwalt to do the right thing. The midshipmen here learn a lot about honor, commitment, and courage. All his life, he exemplified those virtues. His bravery in World War II, in Korea, what he did in Vietnam, his physical courage and leadership led him to become the youngest Chief of Naval Operations in our history. But beyond his physical courage, Bud Zumwalt stood out for his moral courage and for saying what he thought was right, regardless of the consequences.
He sailed through rough waters more than once. We heard Dick Schifter so eloquently chronicle his work in the 1970's to bring back the Navy's strength. When he issued his famous Z-grams, he knew that he was taking on more than 200 years of Navy tradition. But because he took the heat, thousands of naval leaders like former Secretary John Lehman have said they actually made the decision to stay in the Navy because Bud Zumwalt made the Navy exciting again.
When we struggled through the racial tensions of the sixties and seventies, he worked in the face of wilting criticism and a highly resistant institutional culture to make the Navy do the right thing and make the Navy one of the most colorblind institutions in our entire Nation. I know it was a special point of pride for him that the very first African-American admiral earned his star on Bud Zumwalt's watch.
At a time when morale and enthusiasm were at an all-time low, he had the vision to see a great future for the Navy. And even though he lived just to see 2 days of this new century, the changes he brought about three decades ago will continue to shape the character and culture of our Navy for a long time in the 21st century.
Many people have commented on this today, but I want to give you a personal example. Of all the things he inspired, perhaps the greatest impact he had was on the ordinary men and women who served under him. We all know he originally intended to go to West Point, and then a whaling captain set his sails straight. The men and women of the Navy always knew that Bud Zumwalt had their backs, and that loyalty went both ways.
This week we have seen an astonishing outpouring of love and affection from those who served with Admiral Zumwalt. Many of them are here today. This morning, when I was putting on my necktie and getting ready to go out for the day, my naval steward, who has been a Navy enlisted man for more than 30 years, said, ""Mr. President, today you're going to Admiral Zumwalt's service, aren't you?"" I said, ""Yes, I am."" He looked at me and smiled, and he said, ""He's the best we ever had. He was for us.""
He also never forgot to live by the consequences of his commitments. I know there was a family from South Vietnam that was sent after the end of the war to America as refugees, as so many were, and they were sent to my home State of Arkansas. To stay, they were told they had to know someone from our country. The only name they knew was Admiral Zumwalt. When Bud was contacted, to their surprise, the family was actually put on a plane, not to the admiral's home in Maryland but to his son's home in North Carolina, because the admiral already had other refugee families living in his house and he didn't have any more room. When Bud Zumwalt made a commitment, he stuck with it. And when it didn't work out exactly as planned, he honored the consequences and lived by them.
Perhaps the most famous consequence of his leadership during the Vietnam era was the painful loss of his son, Elmo, from the use of Agent Orange, which clearly he ordered because he believed it would save the lives of our people in uniform. So he lived with the consequences of life's greatest loss. He dedicated himself to fighting for those with illnesses caused by Agent Orange.
Hillary and I were honored to work with him to provide treatment and payments to those who survived. He also established the first national bone marrow donor program to help cancer patients in need. He worked with me to pass the Chemical Weapons Convention, which was truly historic in that it outlawed chemical weapons. And for his service to our Navy and afterward, it was my great honor to present him with America's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom.
What I want you to know, Mouza, is that he gave me something and Hillary something even more valuable: honest, caring, steadfast friendship. His letter to our daughter about what her parents tried to do for America is one of our family's most cherished possessions. It is the symbol of everything he was as a man, a leader, and a friend.
And so today we say goodbye to the sailor who never stopped serving his country, never stopped fighting for the men and women in uniform, never stopped being the conscience of the Navy. His earthly voyage is now done. And now he sails beyond the farthest horizon, out of the home port where at last he is safe from all storms.
Bud, we miss you, we love you still, and we will never, ever forget you."
"September 23, 1999",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Lane Kirkland,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-lane-kirkland,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Irena, members of the Kirkland family, Father O'Donovan, Monsignor Higgins, distinguished Members of Congress, visitors from other lands, and my fellow Americans:
I am profoundly honored to be here to pay tribute to a person I admired for many years before I ever thought I would have the chance to work with him as President, a man whom I was honored to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom, because he was, in our time, the very embodiment of the cause of freedom, a man who was both brilliant and articulate and still almost irrationally passionate about the things he knew to be right.
Back in 1985 Lane Kirkland went home to South Carolina, to the State university, and gave one of the most eloquent speeches on the role of Government ever delivered. Perhaps the most memorable line was his reflection on the terms ""liberal"" and ""conservative."" If you look at who is here today to pay tribute to Lane, it's a pretty good place for me to start my remarks.
He said, ""As one who has been afflicted by both labels, depending on the stance of the afflictor and the foreign or domestic nature of the issue, I doubt their utility in this day and age for anyone except slapdash journalists.""
Not only did Lane reject such labels, we all know that he defied the labels, ""liberal"" and ""conservative."" In fact, in many ways, he defied all labels.
He was a man of remarkable contrasts. You've already heard others speak about his humility. He was a true five-star general in the global fight for human liberty, but so down to earth, he was offended if anyone called him anything but Lane.
He was such a powerful force for justice, he could lead hundreds of thousands of working people to march on Washington. But for years, the most powerful force in his own home was a little dachshund named Stanley. He was a man of idealism and strong opinions, but he was genuinely open to people who had the courage to differ with him. He was a gifted intellectual, but on Sunday afternoons, he put his books aside to watch the Redskins on TV. He was a man of the arts, whose perhaps favorite artistry was his harmonica rendition of ""Solidarity Forever."" For all of his contrasts, there was a remarkable consistency underlying everything he thought and said and did.
Both George Meany and Lane used to say, ""The role of the trade unions is to try to keep the big guys from kicking the little guys around."" That was his philosophy of life. And believe me, I got my fair share of lectures about it. [ Laughter ]
He lived it when he walked the picket lines with hotel workers in Las Vegas, when he got arrested with miners in Appalachia, when he quoted the fiery words of Zapata to mistreated Latino janitors in L.A. He lived it when he stood in solidarity with the oppressed workers of the Soviet bloc or helped to tear down the Iron Curtain in Poland and elsewhere in the communist world. He lived it when he struggled for racial and gender equality, when he fought to strengthen the Civil Rights Act, when he championed the cause of women and minorities within the America labor movement, when he helped to rescue the NAACP from bankruptcy.
You could see it in his own office, where he always treated even the most junior members of his staff with the same dignity and respect he demanded for working men and women throughout the world. He stood up for the little guy. It was his ideology. It was also his way of life.
I want to conclude today with a story that was passed along to us at the White House by one of Lane's closest advisers. After he passed away, one of the medics who came to the house took Irena aside and said, ""When I first took this call, the name Kirkland didn't ring any bells. But when I arrived, I realized who your husband was. As the shop steward for my EMS unit, I want you to know how grateful I am for everything your husband did for us. He was a wonderful man, and I know that everyone in my unit feels the same way.""
Well, Irena, for all the distinguished speakers who will pay tribute to your husband today, I don't think any of us could do better than that. So let me just say that I am grateful for this giant of a man, a true American hero, a man who stood up for the little guy. I hope all of us can be faithful to his admonition to do the same. It is the only way we can give him the legacy he has richly earned.
God bless you and your family."
"August 02, 1999",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Dan Dutko,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-dan-dutko,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"First, I would like to say on behalf of Hillary and myself how grateful we are for the life of our friend and how grateful we are for all of you who have come to be with us in honoring it and for those who have spoken before. I have now laughed, and I have cried, and I still miss him terribly.
Of all the metaphors we might use about Dan, most of which are funny, I think one which is not funny that really is best is that he was a gardener, for in all of our lives he planted seeds that bore fruit. In the Psalms, it says, ""A good man shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. His leaves shall not wither. Whatsoever he do, it shall prosper."" Dan made the Earth bloom, wherever he planted himself.
The work and the people he touched were his blossom. All of us in this room, those of us who are in politics, those of us who are in private life, however he knew or touched us, he made us blossom more than we would have otherwise. And therefore, as decreed in the Psalms, his memory will never wither.
Now, I have a story to tell. I met Dan Dutko 27 years ago, in one of our great lost causes. [ Laughter ] I mean, this is a doozy. [ Laughter ] We were in the McGovern campaign in Texas. [ Laughter ] Now, it was bad enough to be in the McGovern campaign anywhere in Texas. [ Laughter ] Dan insisted on leading the effort in west Texas—[ laughter ]—where it was hard to find anyone who would mention Senator McGovern's name.
He wanted to work for the campaign. He actually ran our effort in Tom Green County, where we got 30 percent of the vote. I might add, that was only 3 percent less than we got in the whole State. [ Laughter ] And everyone who looked at it thought it was the most remarkable performance of the entire campaign.
Well, all his life he loved big challenges. He stayed with me, and I turned out to be a bigger one than he bargained for. [ Laughter ] He was really—you know, talk about big words—he was sort of an oxymoron in popular imagination. He was someone others might call a lobbyist, whose integrity, honor were unquestioned. He became a person of consequence in Washington, even though he was born without a nickel to his name, because of that integrity and honor, because of energy and ability, and because, as you see, he had a huge network of devoted friends— enough, Rabbi, that probably we are violating some fire code here today.
He lived too briefly, but he did live the American dream. And he was a self-made man who never forgot where he came from. That's why he stayed in the Democratic Party and loved it so much. He thought everybody ought to have a chance to live out their dreams and become what God meant for them to be.
I want to say just one thing that meant a particular—a lot to me. When we got our brains beat out in the congressional elections of 1994, a lot of people became sunshine soldiers and were running for cover. Not Dan Dutko; man, he stepped out. He said, ""This is just the sort of thing I'm looking for."" [ Laughter ] Everyone wrote us off for dead, said the Democratic Party was becoming a historical artifact. Al Gore and I would have to next appear in a wax museum somewhere. [ Laughter ] Not Dan Dutko. He never had a doubt. He never paused. He never shirked. He was there in '96. The Vice President mentioned his role in our Inaugural in '97. He was there in '98. He was always the guy on our team that no one ever had to buck up. He was always the one who was lifting everyone else up. He was always the one who had that miraculous combination of an infectious smile and a steely will and a genuinely good heart. But most of all, he was a gardener. He planted, and what he planted bloomed.
One of the previous speakers mentioned how much he liked to take promising young people and mentor them and help them flourish. So many of you here are a testament to that, including the new Senator from my home State, Blanche Lincoln, who started her career in Washington here as his personal assistant.
One of the things that I am most grateful that he nurtured was AmeriCorps, our national service program, which Debbie now leads magnificently. Whenever we were having trouble in Congress, he was there. His heart was there. His soul was there. His determination was there. And it came not just from his devotion to his wife but from his belief that all young people should have a chance to serve.
In no small measure, because of Dan Dutko, 100,000 of those young people have had their chance to serve. Hillary told me that even over our last weekend together in Aspen, Dan was talking to her about AmeriCorps' fifth anniversary and asking folks to help out with the celebration.
So we are grateful to him not only for his help to me and the Vice President but for his role in making America a better place. Most of all, we're grateful for his friendship. We loved having Dan and Deb over to the White House to watch movies. He was like me; he liked action movies. We thought there should be a category at the Academy Awards for best performance in totally inane film. [ Laughter ] The last one, we saw together just last month.
I don't think I ever met a man with a more genuine smile, more direct, clear, undebatable sense of good will just coming at you over and over and over again. I'll miss the way he talked about his wife and his sons. I'll miss the fact that he was always there, in the rain as well as the sunshine.
I want Deb, and most of all, his sons, to know that he was one of the principal reasons that I had a chance to serve our country as President. And I want them to know that we all know he was a good and loving father and husband—cared more for them than his own life. And that is something that can sustain them for their lives.
This is a town obsessed with success. We normally score it by winning and losing. So if I might, I would like to close with Ralph Waldo Emerson's definition. He must have written it about Dan Dutko. ""To laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children. To appreciate beauty, find the best in others. To leave the world a little better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition. To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived—this is the meaning of success."" And the meaning of our friend's life."
"January 28, 1999",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Lawton Chiles,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-lawton-chiles,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Lawton would get a huge kick out of knowing that I have just been upstaged by his 10-yearold granddaughter. [ Laughter ] When both the grandkids were singing, I was thinking, you know this is what Lawton would liked to have done if he had not been a politician, sort of the wandering minstrel for America. [ Laughter ] And in some ways, he was.
I looked through the Scripture to find something that referenced how he started his political campaign, and there's a verse in Genesis which says, ""Arise, walk through the land and the length of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it to thee."" I think in so many ways God gave Florida to Lawton so that he could give himself to the people of his beloved State. And in so many ways, his homespun humor and his common sense became the glue that held Florida together as it exploded and diversified and changed in ways that make it almost unrecognizable to people who were there three decades ago.
Every one of us who knew Lawton Chiles feels blessed. If we knew him very well, we loved him. He gave something to all of us. He gave me a lot when we were serving together as Governors. I mean, I couldn't imagine—I was serving as Governor with someone who had been chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. And he made sure that I was always aware of what I should know before I voted however he wanted me to vote in the Governors conference on whatever it was. [ Laughter ]
I loved campaigning with him in Florida. I loved—it's almost a sad thing to say, but it was very moving for me—Florida had a lot of natural disasters during the period in which we served together. It was very moving to me to be in these places with Lawton Chiles, to see the pulse of the people beating in him and the feeling he had for them. I loved all the opportunities he gave me to help Florida, with latenight phone calls about every conceivable subject, the recommendations he gave that Carol Browner and Janet Reno ought to be in the Cabinet.
And like everybody else, I loved the humor. I knew Lawton Chiles long before ""he-coon"" became a part of our political lexicon. And one of the most humbling nights of my life was a night at the Governors conference that I spent with Ann Richards and Lawton Chiles. [ Laughter ] I thought I was a good storyteller. I thought I knew every phrase that had ever been coined. I listened to them talk about how a stuck pig squealed, how a cut dog barks, how if you can't run with the big dogs, you ought to just stay on the porch. [ Laughter ] Listen, I lost that night. [ Laughter ] But I never forgot it.
You know, Lawton may have worn a coonskin cap and coat to his own inaugural ball in 1995, and he did a lot of that ""aw, shucks"" stuff with all of us, but we all know that he was really a visionary. He saw the possibilities and the challenges of the future, and he saw his own life as a sort of continuing obligation to push people toward them.
Long before most of the rest of us, as Senator Domenici and others have already said, he knew that we had to put our budgetary house in order if we wanted our children to have a future. And I'm very glad he got to live to see it come to pass—even though Pete's right, he'd want to see all the numbers and all the books and be a little suspicious.
Carol Browner talked about how he saw that in Florida and in the United States we had to reconcile the imperatives of economic growth and preserving our environment. And because of his vision, the forests and the swamps that he loved so much as a boy, and especially the beautiful Florida Everglades, are going to be preserved.
He saw long before the rest of us the promise in every child and the need to give every child decent health care and a world-class education. The fragile cry of his young grandson who sang for us today, born several months premature, inspired him as Senator and Governor to want to give every child a healthy start in life, the chance to make the most of their God-given talent. How proud he would be to see his grandson making the most of those talents today.
I'm told that as he lay in state in Tallahassee a few weeks ago, a woman from Gadsden County, where Rhea and Lawton first began working to improve prenatal care in Florida, brought her young son to pay his respects. She said that Lawton Chiles had saved her son's life. That boy, and the millions of Florida children growing up healthy and ready, may well be his greatest legacy.
I'd also like to thank him publicly for something else. As Florida explodes and diversifies, he worked so hard to make all his native Floridians—those who were like him—see all the new immigrants as their own, to see those children as a rich resource that would make life more interesting and the future more prosperous.
I thank him for being an early supporter of political and campaign finance reform but in doing it in a way that made sense and didn't raise people's defenses. I don't think he had a sanctimonious bone in his body. He just didn't want everybody to have to spend all their time raising money. He thought it would be better if people talked to one another, face-to-face. He thought it would be better if, on television, people had honest debates and discussions. He didn't go around telling you how much better he was than everybody else because he only took a hundred bucks. And he knew that only one person could have ever made that walk, and then you couldn't just repeat that over and over again. He tried to convince us to relax and think. And he did it in the right way.
Some of you know that, right before he died, I think I had about won a long, intense campaign that I waged to persuade Lawton to become America's Special Envoy to Latin America. He said, ""Well, I don't want to spend a lot of time in Washington."" I said, ""Lawton, it's Latin America, not Washington."" [ Laughter ] I said, ""You know, you'll have to breeze through every now and then and give me a report. There's a telephone. There are fax machines. You can do this."" And he was really getting interested in it.
And I say that not to make anyone sad, but to say that the reason his life was so rich is that he lived to the last hour of the last day thinking about tomorrow, thinking about other people's interest, thinking about other possibilities still to be developed.
So I thank you, Lawton, for teaching us that public service is not a position, it's a mission; that our job is not to posture, but to produce. I thank you for feeling the pulse of the people and making their hopes and dreams your own. I thank you for never losing the light in your eyes, the steel in your spine, the love in your heart.
Young Lawton's song was reminiscent of the wonderful lines from Wordsworth, ""We can make our lives sublime, and departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time."" What wonderful wide, deep footprints our friend left for us to walk in."
"December 05, 1998","Remarks at the Memorial Service for William Maurice Smith, Jr., in Wynne, Arkansas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-service-for-william-maurice-smith-jr-wynne-arkansas,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Jane, Mark, Murray, Annette, all the members of the family and the friends of Maurice. I stayed up late last night and got up early this morning, and I was trying to think of what I should say. I told Maurice I'd be here, and I figured somebody might ask me to talk. So I thought, well, I ought to start with what he would say to me. Some of it is not repeatable in the church. [ Laughter ] But it would go something like this: Expletive deleted, don't say too much. [ Laughter ]
I think all of our lives we will remember a small man with a craggy face, a gravelly voice, a blunt manner, a keen mind, a kind heart, and powerful emotions; a man who was not always good to himself but was always good to others; a man who could say more with fewer words, or just a grunt or the tip of that crazy old hat of his, than anyone we ever knew.
Now, I collected stories the last 3 or 4 days, and this was the odds-on winner: Bill Clark reminded me that in 1984 we had our first meeting in the Governor's office about the ‘84 campaign. And we were sitting there, and I began the meeting by saying that I had been so impressed with Hillary's no-smoking policy at the Governor's Mansion I was going to apply it to the Governor's office. Maurice got his hat, put it on, stood up, and started walking. I said, ""Where you going?"" He said, ""Birdeye."" [ Laughter ] I said, ""I am applying the no-smoking policy of the Governor's Mansion to the Governor's office the day after this next election."" [ Laughter ]
He loved to help people. He loved a good fight. But he never sought to destroy his adversary. He loved political campaigns and legislative sessions. He never met a road or a bridge or a levee he didn't like. [ Laughter ] He loved the Fair Board and the University of Arkansas. He loved the land and the water and the people of this State. Most of all, he loved his family and his friends. He loved us. And how we loved him—often more than I think he knew.
Hillary was home a few weeks ago, and she went by to see Maurice in the hospital. And when she came back to Washington, she looked at me, she said, ""I just love that man."" And she said, ""It seemed to me like everybody else in the hospital did, too.""
I tried to call him over Thanksgiving, and then he called me back, and finally I got him back. We talked twice in the last week. The first time he said, ""I wanted to talk to you one more time. I don't think I'm going to get out this time, and I just want you to know I'm proud of everything we did together, and I love you.""
Well, all of you know that I owe him a lot. He was the finance chairman of all my campaigns, the master of ceremonies at my inaugurations—ensuring that they would be brief— my chief of staff. He served on the university board; he ran the highway department; and on the side, he always lobbied for Jane's causes for the disabled.
But when I was flying down here on Air Force One today, thinking I wouldn't be on this plane if it weren't for him, I thought of a day 18 years ago, when some of us here were standing on the backyard of the Governor's Mansion after the 1980 elections. And I had just become the youngest former Governor in the history of America—[ laughter ]—a man with limited future prospects. And that's pretty much the way I felt. And he put his hand on my shoulder, and he looked me in the eye, and he said, ""It'll be all right; we'll be back.""
I wrote this before I knew the pastor was going to read to us from Luke today. I was thinking of that day today, as we all say farewell to this small man who had such a large impact on all our lives. We say to him, as he said to me so many years ago: Maurice, it'll be all right; God has promised you mercy because you were merciful to us; kindness because you were kind to us; forgiveness because you forgave us; love because you loved us with all your heart. So, farewell, old friend. I say to you what you said to me so many years ago: It'll be all right; you done good; we'll be together again before you know it.
May God bless his soul."
"November 12, 1997",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Representative Walter H. Capps,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-representative-walter-h-capps,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Laura, the staff and friends and admirers of Walter Capps; the first time I met Walter, he was not a Congressman. As a matter of fact, he was a man who had run for and been defeated for Congress. I knew he must be a special man because Laura was working for us, just next to my office, and I knew he had to have been a special father.
So I met this guy, and I thought, this man is entirely too nice to be in Congress anyway. [ Laughter ] Besides that, he speaks in complete sentences and paragraphs. [ Laughter ] He would never get along in Washington in the 1990's; he's happy all the time. [ Laughter ] I don't think he has a mean bone in his body. Well, suffice it to say, when he ran again, I was elated and even happier when he won.
For me, the defining image of the 1996 campaign will always be that magnificent day at the University of Santa Barbara when we were up on the hill and there were 15,000 or more people there, mostly students. It was a sunny day looking out on the ocean, and there was Walter Capps on the stage with me, beaming. You know, he wasn't exactly an experienced campaigner, and he used to joke that I had actually had to grab him and teach him how to smile and wave to a crowd from a stage. He was up there—he said, ""I never had a crowd like this before. I never had a crowd like this before."" [ Laughter ] I said, ""Walter, this is easy. You just go up, put one arm around me and wave the other arm."" [ Laughter ] ""It's easy; you can do this.""
I say this to make a point you have already heard from every previous speaker. The things I taught him were superficial things; the things that he taught us were deep and enduring things. And he seemed to naturally be upbeat, harmonious, uniting. I try to do that, but some days it's a real effort for me. I think it came out of the depths of his soul. I think he was at ease with the consequences of whatever could happen to him. Most people in politics are full of anxiety with the consequences of whatever could happen to them.
He believed in his party, but principles were more important. He liked victory, but values were more important. And he knew that the mind was a wonderful thing, but the heart was more important.
I can only tell you that, for me, perhaps the most important thing was that whenever I saw him, he made me prouder to be in public service. He made me want to stand a little taller. He was always so incredibly ingratiating and humble, and he was—""It's such a big thing to be in the White House,"" and ""I'm so proud my daughter works for the President,"" and all that stuff, you know, but he made me feel better being around him.
He sent a message to young people that public service is a noble thing and that people who commit themselves to it can make positive changes. He was an instant and consistent rebuke to the cynicism that some people try to make their way with in this day and age, especially when they talk about the political system. He taught us about our common humanity, and he left us all a little better than we would have been. And if we remember not only what he said but how he lived, he'll make us a lot better than we would have been.
Hebrews says, ""We are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses, so let us run with patience the race that is before us."" He had a remarkable way of being avid, eager, almost lusty about everything he was trying to take in in life, and yet underneath, there was this calm patience. He had one thing I wish I could have, that I wish we all could—that has already been discussed—and that is, every moment seemed enough and self-contained, and he was always there. The lives we live in Washington leave us so crammed-headed, half the time we're not there in whatever is happening to us. Walter Capps was always there.
For me, because my daughter is the most important person in the world to me and to Hillary, his role as a father meant a lot, and Laura is now a part of our family. But the integrity and the constancy that he brought to that role is something you could see in every single thing he did. So we only had him a little less than a year, and we feel a little cheated. But maybe the lesson from God, through Walter, to us is: It wasn't me; it was you. And we should be a little more like him every day.
That will be his great and enduring gift, not only to us but to the United States.
May God bless his memory and his family."
"July 29, 1997","Remarks at the Funeral Service for Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-justice-william-j-brennan-jr,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Mrs. Brennan, members of the Brennan family, Justices of the Supreme Court, Members of Congress, the administration, Father Jordan, Father O'Hara, Monsignor: Throughout our history, a few powerful ideals have transformed the lives of our people. And throughout our history, there have been a few individuals so devoted to those ideals they could hammer them on the anvil of history to reshape our land and our future.
Often, when our Nation could have fractured, a few have stepped into the breach, bringing us together and moving us forward. Justice Brennan found the ideals in the Constitution time and time again. And time and time again, he stepped into the breach to hammer them on the anvil of our history, saving us from our darker impulses and always pulling us together and pushing us forward. We thank God for his life and work, for Justice Brennan's America is America at its best.
Today we recall his decency and grace which made out of his philosophical foes some close, personal friends. We recall his humor and humility, we recall his pride in his own heritage and the stunning, almost inexplicable empathy that enabled him to walk in the shoes of those whose lives were so very different from his own. We recall him as a legal giant, the balance wheel who molded the Supreme Court into an instrument of liberty and equality during tumultuous times.
For Justice Brennan, the phrases of our Constitution were not archaic abstractions but living, vibrant guarantees of the freedom and equality God has given us. Because of him, those old words came alive in our lives as well. Think of it: Today, the votes of all Americans have equal weight because of Justice Brennan. The press can freely and robustly debate the great issues of the day because of Justice Brennan. Mr. Justice, you'll have to forgive the elected officials here if we have, time to time, doubted the wisdom of that decision—[ laughter ]—which probably proves its correctness. Women can break down the barriers of discrimination in the workplace because of Justice Brennan. The basic freedoms of the Bill of Rights apply to every State in America, giving ordinary citizens redress when their rights have been violated by government, because of Justice Brennan. Lives were lifted up and Americans summoned to live to our highest ideals because of Justice Brennan.
As a young man growing up in the South, I lived through the shame of segregation. I know what it meant when the Supreme Court spoke unanimously and said Little Rock Central High School must open its doors to all. Then, I knew things would never be the same. Now, I know that this transformation was written into our law by Justice Brennan. He became a hero to me, a model for law and service, a real belief to me that if law could serve justice and equality then, 25 years ago, young people like Hillary and me could go into the law, because we thought, like him, we could make a difference by upholding the Constitution's dignity and meaning and working to make it more real in the lives of all Americans.
One of the greatest honors of my Presidency was to bestow on him, and posthumously his friend Justice Marshall, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Tonight the Sun will set over the hills of Arlington National Cemetery on the first night of Justice Brennan's residence there. But the life he lived will never be extinguished, and the life he breathed into our most cherished ideals will never die. He loved his country fiercely. He gave himself to it fully. He strengthened it profoundly, and we are all better for it. We thank God for his life and commend his soul to the Almighty."
"July 18, 1997","Remarks at the Funeral Service for Hilary Jones in Jasper, Arkansas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-hilary-jones-jasper-arkansas,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Pastor, to the members of Hilary's family, and to the legion of friends who are here today, let me say, first of all, that I feel profoundly honored to have been asked by the family to speak for a moment or two about my friend. There's not a person here today who couldn't stand up here and entertain us and relieve our grief for a few moments with Hilary Jones stories. So as we come here to mourn the death of our friend, let us remember, as the pastor said, that death is a part of life for all of us. And let us take a few moments to celebrate his life, for he would have wanted that very much.
I first met Hilary Jones over 23 years ago now, when I first came to Newton County. And I can't exactly describe it, but after the first time I met him, I knew that my life would never quite be the same. He wasn't like anybody I had ever met before, and I have seen a little bit more of the world since then, and I never have met anybody like him since. [ Laughter ]
He introduced me to the beauty, to the history, and the fantastic characters of the Arkansas Ozarks. Some of them are in this church building today. He took me into his home and his heart. I learned a lot about politics and people. I learned that he was quite a disarming human being. The language he spoke was pure Arkansas hillbilly, and I think he enjoyed it if you underestimated his intelligence, which could be a fatal error, for he was a very smart man.
He was deeply interested in people who were different from him and deeply compassionate with people who were in trouble if he thought they were basically good-hearted. And he was so passionate about what he cared about. He cared about his family, and he was so passionate, he had a very big one. [ Laughter ] And he was very proud of them.
He was so passionate about politics that, when I first him, he could actually look at the vote totals in Newton County, precinct by precinct, and tell you whether a family had told him the truth or not about how they were going to vote. [ Laughter ]
He was so passionate about being a Democrat that 22 years ago, when I spoke at the Jasper High School commencement and commended to the seniors the example of Abraham Lincoln as a person who could overcome adversity time and again and keep going in his life, Hilary and a few others—some of whom are in this church today—took me outside and said, ""Bill, that is a wonderful speech. And you can give that speech in Little Rock any day. Don't you ever come up here and brag on that Republican President again."" [ Laughter ]
I must say that years later I was amused when I finally talked him into coming to visit me at the White House. I persuaded him to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom—[ laughter ]— something I failed to do with Bo Forney, sitting back there. [ Laughter ] And afterward, as we kidded him about spending the night at the Lincoln Bedroom, he said, ""I did that for the President, but I stepped on the side of the bed that was under Andrew Jackson's picture."" [ Laughter ]
He was passionate about fish and wildlife. He loved his service on the Game and Fish Commission, and I was honored to appoint him. I think Steve Wilson, whom I see here today, will tell you that they never had a commissioner like him either. He was absolutely fool enough to believe we could bring the elk back to Arkansas. No one else in the State believed it, but he kept doing it. And sure enough, somehow we had the elk come back to Arkansas.
If you were his friend, he was your friend, through thick and thin, in lightness and dark, no matter what happened. If you were his political friend, he was your friend whether you won or you lost. But he believed that people were basically good. And he believed that the purpose of politics was to help ordinary people live their lives better.
And I learned a lot from him about going to the sale barns and the country stores and remote places where most people never went, just to listen to people's hopes and dreams and hurts and fears. And I learned what ferocious power can beat in the heart of any ordinary citizen who believes that he or she can make a difference. Hilary Jones always believed he could make a difference. And he always believed he had an obligation to try, whether it was in the lives of his children or his grandchildren or his friends.
I always felt that somehow, some way, he had adopted me into his family. And I believe he would want me here today if I had never been reelected Governor and had gone out in life as one of history's losers, because Hilary didn't judge people by whether they were on top or on the bottom, he judged them by what they thought was in their hearts.
I loved this man. He was my friend, my brother, my surrogate uncle or father. But what he was to me he was to literally hundreds of other people. Look around this church today. God gave Hilary Jones a great gift, a unique blend of heart and mind and energy and passion that very few people in this life in any position ever have. And he used it well.
We will miss him. We may not ever see anybody like him again. But I ask his family to remember as their hearts are broken that this, too, is part of God's plan and how blessed they were that he was their father and our friend.
Thank you."
"June 26, 1997","Remarks at the Funeral Service for Henry Oren Grisham in Hope, Arkansas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-henry-oren-grisham-hope-arkansas,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Reverend Hight, Duayne and Conrad and Falva and Myra and all the family, we come here to celebrate the life of one of the most truly remarkable people I have ever known, a man without wealth or power, without position or any pretense, who was, nonetheless, loved, admired, respected because he was smart and wise, profoundly good, and I might add, very funny.
There will be a lot of tears shed in the family section today, and you might say, well, how could you cry that much for a man who had God's gift of 92 years? Because he was forever young, and we wish he'd lived to be 192.
Everyone who ever knew him had a story about him, about hunting or fishing or farming, about sharing a meal or swapping a tale. One of the young men at the funeral home came up to me this morning just before we came out and said, ""You know, he always kept me up. He made me laugh.""
One of the members of the family said he was the salt of the Earth and the spice of life. Everyone who talks about him has clear, vivid memories of his wit and his wisdom and, I might add, his remarkable ability to be both brutally honest and always kind.
When I was a young boy, badly in need of a hand up and a little kindness and wisdom, whenever I was at his house and Ollie's, I always felt at home. But he always treated everybody that way. After I became a grown man, he only called me one time, in our whole life together, just once, to tell me that in 1979, a year before all the experts said it, that I could not be reelected Governor because I had made people mad. And I said, ""Well, what do you think I ought to do about it?"" He said, ""Tell them you made a mistake and undo it, for goodness sake."" I said, ""I can't do that."" He said, ""Good, after the next election, you'll have a lot more time to spend with me."" [ Laughter ] And he was right.
After Ollie got sick and died, he still continued to drive around and be active. And I told Reverend Hight this morning the funny story he told me. In the last few years, he used to take two ladies who were older than he was, in their nineties, driving once a week. He said, ""Nobody else would go take them out, so I would just go take them out once a week and drive them around. We have a grand time."" He was about 87 at the time. And I said, ""Do you like these older women?"" He said, ""You know, I do. It seems like they're a little more settled."" [ Laughter ]
The great poet William Wordsworth said that the last, best hope of a good man's life are the little unremembered acts of kindness and love. I'll bet you every person here today who ever met that man has an act of kindness and love that you remember.
He really did the things that matter most in life very well. He was a great husband, a great father, a great grandfather, a great uncle. He was a great friend.
My most vivid memory of him, I think, will always be after Ollie got sick and they had to put her in a place where she could be cared for. And he was going through this awful period when she was failing, and he loved her so much. I stopped to see him one night in his house, and we were all alone there. We talked and shot the breeze for a long time. We laughed, and he told stories, and everything was just normal. And finally, it was real late, and I had to drive back to Little Rock, and I said, ""Buddy, I've got to go."" He said, ""Okay."" I was on my way out the door, and he grabbed me by the arm, and I turned around, and he had tears in his eyes—it was the only time I ever saw them—and I said, ""This is really hard, isn't it?"" And he smiled, and he said, ""You know, it is. But when I married her, I signed on for the whole load, and most of it's been pretty good."" I have never heard a better testament of love and devotion than that.
So I say of his great life, all of it was more than pretty good. If our country and our world had more people like Henry Oren Grisham, how much better it would be, how many more children would have a happy childhood, how much more peace and harmony there would be.
Conrad's poem said it all, and I'm pretty sure God heard it.
Thank you. God bless you."

Clinton,eulogy,"Mrs. Boorda, Mike's family, Secretary Christopher and our friends from the diplomatic corps, Secretary Perry, Secretary Dalton, General Shalikashvili, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, unified commanders in chief, the leadership and Members of Congress who are here, Admiral Johnson and the flag leadership of our Navy, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Hagan, to our great Navy sailors and all of America's Armed Forces. Today we come to honor and give thanks for the life of Mike Boorda, a special man who earned a special place in the heart of his Navy and the heart of our Nation. He lived a life that makes America proud, beginning, of course, with his family. His first words upon becoming Chief of Naval Operations were, ""I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Bettie, and I wouldn't want to be here without her.""
To Bettie and David and Edward and Anna, your families, I know there is nothing we can say or do to ease the loss of your husband and father and grandfather. I hope you find comfort in the love and respect and honor that surrounds you today, here in this great cathedral and all throughout our great land. I thank you for your service to the Navy. I thank you, Bettie. I thank you, Edward and Robert, for your service. I thank you, David, for your work on the radio. I thank you, Anna, for your devotion and for your husband's service, and Edward, for your wife's service. But your entire family is a model, a reflection of Mike Boorda's remarkable love for the Navy, a Navy in which he enlisted when he was just 16.
When he was first in his class at personnelman school in San Diego, he was offered his choice of assignments. Displaying his characteristic compassion, he traded the slot with a friend whose wife was sick and expecting a baby. So the friend got to stay in San Diego, and Mike got shipped to Oklahoma. Oklahoma's coastline leaves something to be desired for people designing a career in the Navy. But it turned out to be a first-rate assignment because that's where he met Bettie.
He was commissioned an officer in 1962. Then his star rose fast and bright with important assignments, from weapons officer aboard destroyers to Chief of Naval Personnel to commander in chief of our Naval forces in Europe and CINC of the Southern Command. And as all of you know, 2 years ago just last month, he became the very first enlisted man in the entire history of the United States Navy to be the Chief of Naval Operations.
At every turn he led in helping us, our country, live up to its responsibilities as the world's leading force for freedom. He served two tours of duty in Southeast Asia. As has been said today, as commander in chief of Allied Forces in Southern Europe, he ordered the first offensive action in NATO's history, the strikes against Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.
I know his family is especially proud of the role he played and the role that they supported in getting food and relief to the war-torn people of Bosnia. I very much want history to record that Mike Boorda's quiet determination to do all we could do to end the slaughter of the children and the innocents in Bosnia and to bring that awful war to an end had a profound impact on his President and on the policy of this Nation.
Even after he became Chief of Naval Operations, I continued to ask him what he thought we should do to get a reality check on the rest of the advice I was given. And I want to say to all of you what I said to his family this last weekend. It is my belief that perhaps more than any other military officer in this country, Mike Boorda helped to lead us to the point of peace at Dayton. And there are countless thousands of people alive in Bosnia today because of this small man with a big heart, a large vision, and great courage.
He developed new strategies to carry our Navy into the 21st century. He spearheaded projects like theater ballistic missile defense and the arsenal ship that have put our Navy on the cutting edge of technology.
Like all great sailors, he loved the sea, and he loved sea stories. The stories about him are legion and now legend. I'm told that when I nominated him to be the Chief of Naval Operations, he called his mother, Trudy Wallace, from Italy to tell her that he was about to become the CNO. She asked if it was a promotion.
He said, ""No, I'm already a four-star admiral."" She asked if he were going to get a raise. He said, ""No, I'll be making a little less; I'm losing my overseas living allowance."" She then said, ""Well, surely you'll get a bigger house."" And he said, ""Actually, it will be smaller than the Mediterranean villa we have now."" Apparently, his mother then said, ""Well, don't you have enough time in to retire?"" [ Laughter ] Now, every family has got a story like that. Well, he didn't get a raise or a promotion or a bigger house, but he got a bigger job, and he did his mother and his family and his country proud.
Many have said before me that his lasting legacy will be his concern for the sailors. He knew the people were the Navy's greatest asset. And every day he made the Navy stronger because he took good care of its sailors. He loved the bluejackets, and he loved the officers. When he came on board a ship or entered a room of sailors, you could see the twinkle in his eye. Without ever ranting or reprimanding, criticizing or cajoling, he found a way to bring out the best of everyone, seaman or admiral, boatswain mate to battle group commander. Talk to him for just a few moments, and you couldn't help but like him; you couldn't help but love our Navy even more and want to do the best you could for our country.
He also understood that beyond the things that he fought for that were material for our men and women in uniform, beyond the better housing, the better pay, the better time at home with families, there was, above all, the importance of caring and compassion. Last year in Norfolk, he spoke to a theater full of sailors. The chief machinist mate nervously stepped up to the microphone and explained his predicament. His wife had recently passed away, and he was left with two young daughters. He told the CNO that he had 6 months before his retirement date, but he would have to reenlist before then, and that meant more sea duty and separation from his children. Right there at the mike, the CNO asked, ""So you want to retire in June?"" The MMC meekly replied, ""Yes, sir."" And right then and there, Admiral Boorda said, ""Your request is approved. We'll work it out.""
The Admiral used to joke about being small in stature. Shortly after I named him Chief of Naval Operations, we were in the English Channel together, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion on the aircraft carrier the George Washington. And I spoke just as I am now, but I had the Presidential lectern there. And when I finished, he was coming up, so I pulled out the stand for him to stand on. And he got up, and he looked at me, and he said, ""You know, this is the second time you've elevated me in the last couple of months."" [ Laughter ]
Well, that's the kind of sense of honor he had. Even though he was very small, the rest of us always looked up to him, looked up to his ability somehow to inspire us all to do better, to reach beyond ourselves.
There was reported in the press a Navy photographer's remarks I would like to repeat who said, ""Everyone was always asking me to take photos with him. They wanted to stand next to the best thing the Navy had.""
Before I came over here today, I visited the Pentagon. And I went to the Navy Command Center to the briefing room that Admiral Boorda began his day in several times a week to thank the staff who worked with him every day and who can't be with us here today because they're on duty, as he would want them to be. And they were encouraged to tell me whatever they want. I thought you might be interested to know what those people who are now over at the Pentagon, doing the work they did every day for Mike Boorda, had to say to me.
One said, ""There's a $5 bill over there on the wall. Do you see it, Mr. President?"" I said, ""Yes, I did."" He said, ""That's the bet the Admiral had with the weatherman every time we had a briefing. He always bet against the weatherman. And as of the last bet, he was $5 ahead."" Another said that every time there was a briefing in the morning, he brought in strips of bacon and literally shoved bacon at everyone else. He was always trying to share his bacon and make people laugh about it. A third said that the thing that meant the most to her was that at Christmastime he literally greeted every single sailor in the Pentagon. No matter how much time it took, that's what he did.
A young sailor in the office said that the thing that moved her most was that she handled his correspondence, and he would never let her send a form letter. Even when someone wrote to him and went outside the chain of command, he would write a gentle letter back explaining what the chain of command was. But it was always a personal letter, so that the young sailor who wrote would know that the CNO really cared and really read the letter.
And finally, one very large African-American sailor from the State of Tennessee stood up in the back of the room, and he said, ""Mr. President, how can we ever replace this man?""
In the Bible there is the great story of two warriors and friends, David and Jonathan. When they prepared to part, Jonathan said, ""Tomorrow there is a new Moon, and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty."" Mike Boorda's seat is empty, and how we shall miss his warm smile, his easy manner, his wonderful voice, his sharp wit. What a legacy he has left behind: his ferocious devotion to all of you; his commitment to give all of you a chance to be the very best that you can be, to give our country its chance for true greatness; his deep sense of honor, which no person should ever question.
Now Mike Boorda's ship is moored. His voyage is complete. But I know when the whistle blew and the colors were shifted, he was welcomed on the pier by God's loving, eternal embrace. May God bless and cherish Admiral Mike Boorda as he blessed and cherished our lives and our beloved America."

I begin by saying to all of you, on behalf of all of us, we thank you for the strength you have given to others even as you have borne your own grief, for we can see Ron in your eyes and hear him in your voices and feel his strength in yours. Indeed, I was confident, as I heard Michael speak, that from heaven Ron had written the words. So today and in all of our tomorrows, as we remember and love him, we will remember and love you. We hope on this day amidst all the grief you will also feel gratitude for his magnificent life, determination to carry on his legacy and keep it alive, and the peace of God which takes us to a place beyond all our understanding.
The Bible tells us, ""though we weep through the night, joy will come in the morning."" Ron Brown's incredible life force brought us all joy in the morning. No dark night could ever defeat him. And as we remember him, may we always be able to recover his joy. For this man loved life and all the things in it. He loved the big things: his family, his friends, his country, his work, his African-American heritage. He loved the difference he was making in the world, this new and exciting world after the cold war.
And he loved life's little things: the Redskins and basketball and golf, even when it was bad, and McDonald's and clothes. And I'm telling you, folks, he would have loved this deal today. I mean, here we are for Ron Brown in the National Cathedral with full military honors, filled with the distinguished citizenry of this country and leaders from around the world in a tribute to him. And as I look around, I see that all of us are dressed almost as well as he would be today. [ Laughter ]
But let us remember also that he loved success, but not so much he wanted to succeed at the wrong things or in the wrong way. And he always remembered that worldly success doesn't take us too very far from all the rest of our fellow human beings who don't enjoy as much of it. That accounts for why he was always so kind to people without regard to their station in life.
Ron Brown enjoyed a lot of success. He proved you could do well and do good. He also proved you could do good and have a good time. And he also proved that you could do all that and, at the same time, still take time to help other people.
With his passion and determination, his loves and his joys, his going beyond the stereotypes of his time, he lived a truly American life. He lived his life for America, and when the time came, he was found laying down his life for America.
What a life it was, with his remarkable enthusiasm that infected everything he did. As long as I live I will remember the time Ron Brown and I were walking the streets of the neighborhood in Los Angeles, and we went to this sporting goods store that had been owned by some people who were trying to help young folks stay out of gangs. And in the back of the sporting goods store, there was a basketball court. And all these little kids had gathered around, and they asked Ron and they asked me if we would like to play basketball. So we divided up sides. He took a few kids. I took a few kids. All of a sudden he forgot who was President and how he got his day job. [ Laughter ] He was totally caught up in the drama of the game. This was an important trip we took, but afterward, whenever anyone asked him about that trip, all he could remember to say was, ""The President was in my face from 20 feet out, but when I shot, nothing but net."" [ Laughter ]
Ron Brown was very clever. Even as a young boy at the Hotel Teresa, ""Little Brown,"" as Joe Louis called him, was always trying to think of what else could be done. He met all kinds of celebrities, as has been widely chronicled, men like Louis Armstrong and Sugar Ray Robinson and women like Lena Horne and Dinah Washington. And he did what most kids do, even today, he got their autographs. But unlike most kids, he sold them to his friends. [ Laughter ] According to Michael, he sold two to a page, five bucks a pop, until Joe Louis found out and shut down his act. [ Laughter ] But it was too late. He was well on his way to becoming the Secretary of Commerce. [ Laughter ]
He was daring. We all know that. He was daring when he announced he wanted to be the chairman of the Democratic Party, after we had lost three Presidential elections. And no one thought he had a chance to win. Then when he won, he announced that in 1992 the world's oldest political party would win the White House again. And nobody thought he was right, including the Governor of a small Southern State. [ Laughter ] But as with so many other things, he was right, and the rest of us were wrong.
On a personal note, I want to say to my friend just one last time: Thank you; if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here.
Ron Brown was a true leader, and he knew that in his mind that meant you could never show doubt, even if you had to kind of make it up as you went along. I later learned this story about his acceptance of the job I offered him. I sent for Ron. He came to see me, and I said, ""You know, this is a big, new world out there, and you ought to be Secretary of Commerce. You could change the future of America and millions of other people around the world. You could make a real difference."" And he said, ""That sounds good. I want to think about it."" I later learned that he walked out and went to see our mutual friend Harold Ickes and said, ""Harold, what does the Secretary of Commerce do?"" [ Laughter ]
By the time he arrived, he knew. He knew better than anyone else. He came on like a force of nature. Yesterday I received a letter from one of the many business executives that Ron Brown helped to open new markets around the world. He's on our Export Council, and he said in this letter, ""You know, Mr. President, Ron Brown really is the finest Secretary of Commerce the United States ever had.""
He also remembered what it was he was leaning toward. Ron Brown made his staff memorize a one-sentence mission statement about their job at Commerce. Here it is: The mission of the Department of Commerce is to ensure economic opportunity for every American.
That was Ron. He wanted to give other people a chance to live a good life and live the American dream. He wanted to do it in a way that helped people around the world to lift their aspirations. He went after it with everything he had. He used to say to me, ""If what we have to do means getting the government out of the way, let's lead the charge. And if what we have to do means working together to find some new solution, let's lead the charge. But let's get it done. Let's fulfill the mission.""
He also never forgot that there are always some people who are left behind. I want to tell you this story because to me it captures so much the essence of what made him very special. When we first came into office we only had about a month to put our first budget together. And we knew we had to do some pretty tough things to get the deficit way down. Day after day, the Cabinet would gather in the Roosevelt Room; Ron was always there. And on one of those days, we talked about the need not only to cut the budget but to do some really symbolic things that would show the American people we were different and we stood for the right things. And we were all, frankly, being just a little sanctimonious in looking for symbolic gestures.
And so we were talking about the need to cut the perks that had previously been provided to top officials, things like chefs in the Secretary's dining room and chauffeurs for a lot of higher ranking officials. And we talked about them, frankly, all of us, nonchalantly and fairly sanctimoniously until Ron turned to me and said, ""You know, these cuts are the right thing to do, Mr. President. It is the right thing to do. But I'd just like to remind people that there are real human beings in those jobs as chefs and chauffeurs. A lot of those folks are my age. Many are black men. Most of them never had the opportunities you and I did. So let's go on and do the right things and make the cuts. But let's not forget about those people, and let's try to help them go on with their lives in dignity.""
No one else said that but Ron Brown. He could see where we had to go. He knew it was the right thing to do. But he had enough peripheral vision to know how other people were being affected.
That last thing I'd like to say about his remarkable public life is that while he was often determined to be first, he was equally determined that he would never be the last. And so he exerted more extraordinary effort than virtually anybody I've ever known to develop the talents of other people, to reach out to the young, to give them a chance to serve. How much of the weeping we have done this last week because there were so many brilliant young people on that plane with him from different backgrounds and different racial groups. Why? Because Ron Brown could see in them the promise of a new tomorrow, and he knew they needed someone to reach down and give them the opportunity to serve.
And I hope that is something that none of us will ever forget. For his legacy burns brightly not only in the lives of his wife and children and other family members but also all of those brilliant young men and women, many of whom are with us today, who walked through the doors that he opened and crossed over the bridges that he built.
I received a lot of letters and calls, like many of you have, since Ron died. I got this letter from Michael Armstrong, the chairman of Hughes Electronics, who was one of the people Ron worked with. And I wanted to read this to you, because so often we think Government operates in a vacuum. Listen to this:
""While the demands of business, the pressures of the Commerce Department, and the politics of Washington can often mask the spirit and character of the dedicated people who try so hard to make a difference for America, the business at hand, the pressures on the Department, and the politics of the moment never dimmed the smile, the energy, the commitment, and the leadership of the man who made such a big difference in the direction and destiny of our country. He led his party to the Presidency. He led the Commerce Department with imagination and distinction. He led American business to new global opportunity. He led his race as an unassuming but forceful role model. He led us all in being what he believed in. He was truly a leader.""
Ron Brown: a trailblazer, a builder, a patriot; a husband, a father, a wonderful friend, and a great American.
Let us remember these things about Ron. Let us always have our joy in the morning. Let us be determined to carry on his legacy. Let us always be vigilant, as he was, in fighting against any shred of racism and prejudice. Let us always be vigilant, as he was, in remembering that we cannot lift ourselves up by tearing other people down, that we have to go forward together. Let us always remember, as he did, that Alexis de Tocqueville was right when he said so many years ago, America is great because America is good. He knew we had to keep working and striving to be better.
In his last sermon from the pulpit, Martin Luther King asked God to grant us all a chance to be participants in the newness and magnificent development of America. That is the cause for which Ron Brown gave his life and the cause for which he gave up his life.
In his letter to the Galatians, St. Paul said, ""Let us not grow weary in doing good. For in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart."" Our friend never grew weary; he never lost heart. He did so much good, and he is now reaping his reward. He left us sooner than we wanted him to leave, but what a legacy of love and life he left behind.
Now he's in a place where he doesn't even have to worry about how good he looks. He always will look good. He's in a place where there's always joy in the morning. He's in a place where every good quality he ever had has been rendered perfect. He's in a place he deserves to be because of the way he lived and what he left to those of us who loved him.
Let there always be joy in the morning for Ron Brown. Amen."
"January 20, 1996","Remarks at the Funeral Service for Barbara Jordan in Houston, Texas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-barbara-jordan-houston-texas,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Thank you. Pastor Cofield; Bennie and Rosemary and John; and Aunt and Uncle, Mamie and Wilmer Lee; Mr. Mayor; my good friend Governor Richards; all the distinguished Texans who are here; and friends of Barbara Jordan around the country; Members of Congress; members of the Texas State government; the former Members of Congress who served with Barbara who came down with me today; to members of the Cabinet; my fellow Americans.
The last time I saw Barbara Jordan was late last fall when Liz Carpenter talked me into going to the University of Texas to give a speech on race relations on the day of the Million Man March. I was nervous enough as it was. [ Laughter ] And I walked out into that vast arena, and there were 17,000 people there. But I could only see one, Barbara Jordan, smiling at me. And there I was about to give a speech to her about race and the Constitution. [ Laughter ] I think it was the nearest experience on this Earth to the pastor's giving a sermon with God in the audience. [ Laughter ]
Through the sheer force of the truth she spoke, the poetry of her words, and the power of her voice, Barbara always stirred our national conscience. She did it as a legislator, a Member of Congress, a teacher, a citizen. Perhaps more than anything else in the last few years, for those of us who had the privilege of being around her, she did it in the incredible grace and good humor and dignity with which she bore her physical misfortunes. No matter what, there was always the dignity. When Barbara Jordan talked, we listened.
We listened in 1974 when she said of the preamble to our Constitution, ""We the people. It is a very eloquent beginning, but when the document was completed on the 17th of September in 1787, I was not included in that 'we the people.""'
We listened in 1976 when President Carter asked her to be the first black woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic Convention. When she asked and answered one of those great questions with which we still struggle, she said, ""Are we to be one people bound together by common spirit, sharing in a common endeavor, or will we become a divided nation? A spirit of harmony will survive in America,"" she said, ""only if each of us remember that we share a common destiny.""
We listened in 1992 when she honored me by again giving a keynote address at the convention. ""The American dream is slipping away from too many people,"" she said. She said it would only be changed if we developed an environment characterized by a devotion to the public interest, to public servants, to tolerance, and to love.
After I became President, I asked her to chair the United States Commission on Immigration Reform. And she made us listen again when she reminded all sides on that delicate and difficult issue that we must remain both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.
Barbara Jordan's life was a monument to the three great threads that run constantly throughout the fabric of American history: our love of liberty, our belief in progress, our search for common ground. Wherever she could and whenever she stood to speak, she jolted the Nation's attention with her artful and articulate defense of the Constitution, the American dream, and the common heritage and destiny we share, whether we like it or not.
Barbara Jordan loved her family, her loved ones, her friends, her allies, her teachers. She loved Texas. And how she loved our beloved country. She reveled in its never-ending struggle to live up to our highest ideals.
She once said this: ""All we are trying to do is to make this Government of the United States honest. We only ask that when we stand up and talk about one Nation under God with liberty and justice for all, we want to be able to look up at the flag, put our right hands over our hearts, repeat those words, and know that they are true."" Well, if Barbara wasn't in the Constitution when it was first written, she made sure that once she got in, she stayed in it all the way.
She also did all she could as a lawmaker and as a teacher to give future generations of Americans for all time to come equal standing under that Constitution. That's what she was doing when God called her home, working with the students at the University of Texas Lyndon Johnson School of Public Affairs.
In 1994, in one of the most enjoyable moments of my Presidency, I was proud to give to Barbara Jordan the Nation's highest award to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I noticed her wearing it today. And it touched me so to know that she is now going to a place where her rewards will be greater.
As Ann Richards said, if we're all going to tell the truth today, Barbara Jordan made every one of us stand a little straighter, speak a little clearer, and be a little stronger. She took to heart what her Grandpa Patten told her when she was a little girl. ""You just trot your own horse, and don't get into the same rut as everyone else."" [ Laughter ] Well, she sure trotted her own horse, and she made her own path wide and deep.
Let me close with these lines from a poem I love by Stephen Spender. I understand Barbara loved it, too, and liked to read it aloud. I can't read it as well as she would have, but you'll see it could have been written about her. ""I think continually of those who are truly great, who from the womb remembered the soul's history, who wore at their hearts the fire's center. Born of the sun, they traveled a short while toward the sun, and left the vivid air signed in their honor.""
Barbara's magnificent voice is silenced. But she left the vivid air signed in her honor. Barbara, we the people will miss you. We thank you, and Godspeed."
"January 04, 1996","Remarks at the Funeral Service for Admiral Arleigh A. Burke in Annapolis, Maryland",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-admiral-arleigh-burke-annapolis-maryland,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Vice Admiral Metcalf, we thank you for your remarks and for your service. Admiral Owens, Admiral Boorda, Admiral Larson, Secretary Dalton, Deputy Secretary White, Senator Lugar, Senator Chafee, Mr. Perot, Mr. Justice White, to the members of the diplomatic corps who are here, representatives of the four services, all those who served with Arleigh Burke, Dr. Ward, and most especially Mrs. Burke.
We gather today to honor the life of one of the Navy's finest sailors and greatest leaders. Every life is a lesson, but his life particularly so, for in 94 years on this Earth, at sea and on land, Arleigh Burke gave nothing less than everything he had for his cherished Navy and his beloved country. Born at the dawn of this century on a hardscrabble farm at the foot of the Colorado Rockies, educated at this great Academy, wed to his wife 72 years ago here in this very chapel, Arleigh Burke stood watch over our freedom for more than four decades.
Late this summer, just before I traveled to Pearl Harbor to commemorate the end of the Second World War, I had the honor of spending an evening with Admiral Burke at the Pentagon. This hero of long nights and long days of the Pacific war gave me his wise counsel—and like so many of my predecessors, I came away far richer for it—in an evening I will never forget.
As a Navy captain in 1943, it was Arleigh Burke who understood the full potential of the Navy's destroyers, its ""tin cans."" In so doing, he helped turn the tide in freedom's favor— at Empress Augusta Bay, off Cape St. George, and across vast stretches of the South Pacific. During one campaign that spanned 22 separate engagements, Burke and his squadron of Little Beavers, some of whom are here with us today, accomplished astonishingly big feats. They demolished an enemy cruiser, 9 destroyers, a submarine, 9 smaller ships, and downed some 30 aircraft.
Later, while serving under Admiral Marc Mitscher, Arleigh Burke pulled shipmates from the flaming aftermath of kamikaze attacks and helped plan the war's concluding battles at Philippine Sea, Leyte, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. For that extraordinary heroism and grand vision, he earned the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart.
Like all good sailors, Admiral Burke had the ability to see over the horizon. He taught the Navy how to fight at night, attacking with torpedoes as well as guns. As Chief of Naval Operations for those unprecedented three terms, he created the most balanced, versatile fleet in history, one that enabled us to preserve the peace and safeguard our freedom throughout all of the hard days of the cold war. He built nuclear submarines so that our Navy would be as strong below the ocean's surface as it was above it. He armed them with Polaris missiles so we could better deter Soviet attacks. He took from blueprint to shipyard the idea of a fleet propelled by the power of the atom.
The Navy all Americans are so proud of, the Navy that stood up to fascism and stared down communism and advances our values and freedom even today, that Navy is Arleigh Burke's Navy.
Today we mourn the passing of a great American. But his spirit is all around us. We see it in the promise of the young midshipmen who will take on the challenge of living up to his magnificent example. We see it in the fine men of the ship that bears Admiral Burke's name and who will soon man the rails on the road to his gravesite. We see it in all the Arleigh Burke class destroyers that are protecting peace and helping democracy take root from the Persian Gulf to Haiti, to the former Yugoslavia.
These destroyers, each named for a naval hero, a naval leader such as John Paul Jones, John Berry, and just recently, Winston Churchill, are a special class of ships, the class of Arleigh Burke . Admiral Burke was the inspiration for these ships. They were meant to be feared and fast, the very attributes that earned their nickname—their namesake the nickname ""31-Knot Burke."" And they are both feared and fast. Today, in memory of this destroyerman, I have ordered all the Burke class and Little Beaver squadron ships currently underway to steam at 31 knots for 5 minutes beginning at noon.
Arleigh Burke's life spanned what has come to be called the American century, one in which the American people understood our Nation's special place in the world as a force for freedom and hope and peace. As the new century approaches, it is fair to say that no American did more to act upon that responsibility than Arleigh Burke. The freedoms we cherish, the peace we enjoy were sustained by his vision and his labors. Those freedoms and that peace are his greatest legacy. As long as we remain devoted to them, we will stay faithful to him and to the remarkable generation of Americans he helped to lead.
My fellow Americans, the challenges we face today are new. The foes who oppose us have changed. But the values and the interests we must stand for are the same ones Arleigh Burke dedicated his 18-hour days to preserve, the same freedom and peace and democracy and human dignity.
With Arleigh Burke's passing, we change the watch. A new generation takes the helm. May it find guidance and inspiration in the lessons of his long life so well lived. And may it stay true to the course Admiral Burke set of peace through strength, of freedom through sacrifice, of success through tireless devotion to duty.
Mrs. Burke, you were the Admiral's partner throughout his long and rich life. You blessed him greatly with your love, as his powerful quote on the front of our program so clearly says. In turn, he blessed America with his service.
May God now bless Arleigh Burke in the warm embrace of His eternal love. In the timeless words of the sailor, ""Fair winds and following seas."""
"November 06, 1995","Remarks at the Funeral of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem, Israel",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-prime-minister-yitzhak-rabin-jerusalem-israel,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Leah, to the Rabin children and grandchildren and other family members, President Weizman, Acting Prime Minister Peres, members of the Israeli Government and the Knesset, distinguished leaders from the Middle East and around the world, especially His Majesty King Hussein for those remarkable and wonderful comments and President Mubarak for taking this historic trip here, and to all the people of Israel.
The American people mourn with you in the loss of your leader. And I mourn with you, for he was my partner and friend. Every moment we shared was a joy because he was a good man and an inspiration because he was also a great man.
Leah, I know that too many times in the life of this country you were called upon to comfort and console the mothers and the fathers, the husbands and the wives, the sons and the daughters who lost their loved ones to violence and vengeance. You gave them strength. Now, we here, and millions of people all around the world, in all humility and honor, offer you our strength. May God comfort you among all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.
Yitzhak Rabin lived the history of Israel. Through every trial and triumph, the struggle for independence, the wars for survival, the pursuit of peace—in all he served on the frontlines. This son of David and of Solomon took up arms to defend Israel's freedom and laid down his life to secure Israel's future.
He was a man completely without pretense, as all of his friends knew. I read that in 1949, after the War of Independence, David Ben-Gurion sent him to represent Israel at the armistice talks at Rhodes, and he had never before worn a necktie and did not know how to tie the knot. So the problem was solved by a friend who tied it for him before he left and showed him how to preserve the knot simply by loosening the tie and pulling it over his head. Well, the last time we were together, not 2 weeks ago, he showed up for a black-tie event on time but without the black tie. And so he borrowed a tie, and I was privileged to straighten it for him. It is a moment I will cherish as long as I live.
To him, ceremonies and words were less important than actions and deeds. Six weeks ago, the King and President Mubarak will remember, we were at the White House for signing the Israel-Palestinian agreement. And a lot of people spoke. I spoke; the King spoke; Chairman Arafat spoke; President Mubarak spoke; our foreign ministers all spoke. And finally Prime Minister Rabin got up to speak, and he said, ""First, the good news: I am the last speaker."" But he also understood the power of words and symbolism. ""Take a look at the stage,"" he said in Washington. ""The King of Jordan, the President of Egypt, Chairman Arafat, and us, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Israel, on one platform. Please take a good, hard look. The sight you see before you was impossible, was unthinkable just 3 years ago. Only poets dreamt of it. And to our great pain, soldier and civilian went to their deaths to make this moment possible."" Those were his words.
Today, my fellow citizens of the world, I ask all of you to take a good, hard look at this picture. Look at the leaders from all over the Middle East and around the world who have journeyed here today for Yitzhak Rabin and for peace. Though we no longer hear his deep and booming voice, it is he who has brought us together again here in word and deed for peace.
Now it falls to all of us who love peace and all of us who loved him to carry on the struggle to which he gave life and for which he gave his life. He cleared the path, and his spirit continues to light the way. His spirit lives on in the growing peace between Israel and her neighbors. It lives in the eyes of the children, the Jewish and the Arab children who are leaving behind a past of fear for a future of hope. It lives on in the promise of true security.
So let me say to the people of Israel, even in your hour of darkness, his spirit lives on, and so you must not lose your spirit. Look at what you have accomplished: making a once barren desert bloom, building a thriving democracy in a hostile terrain, winning battles and wars and now winning the peace, which is the only enduring victory. Your Prime Minister was a martyr for peace, but he was a victim of hate.
Surely we must learn from his martyrdom that if people cannot let go of the hatred of their enemies, they risk sowing the seeds of hatred among themselves. I ask you, the people of Israel, on behalf of my Nation that knows its own long litany of loss, from Abraham Lincoln to President Kennedy to Martin Luther King, do not let that happen to you.
In the Knesset, in your homes, in your places of worship, stay the righteous course. As Moses said to the children of Israel when he knew he would not cross over into the Promised Land, ""Be strong and of good courage, fear not for God will go with you. He will not fail you. He will not forsake you."" President Weizman, Acting Prime Minister Peres, to all the people of Israel, as you stay the course of peace, I make this pledge: Neither will America forsake you.
Legend has it that in every generation of Jews from time immemorial, a just leader emerged to protect his people and show them the way to safety. Prime Minister Rabin was such a leader. He knew as he declared to the world on the White House lawn 2 years ago that the time had come, in his words, ""to begin a new reckoning in the relations between people, between parents tired of war, between children who will not know war."" Here in Jerusalem, I believe with perfect faiths that he was leading his people to that promised land.
This week, Jews all around the world are studying the Torah portion in which God tests the faith of Abraham, patriarch of the Jews and the Arabs. He commands Abraham to sacrifice Yitzhak. ""Take your son, the one you love, Yitzhak."" As we all know, as Abraham in loyalty to God was about to kill his son, God spared Yitzhak. Now, God tests our faith even more terribly, for he has taken our Yitzhak.
But Israel's covenant with God, for freedom, for tolerance, for security, for peace, that covenant must hold. That covenant was Prime Minister Rabin's life's work. Now we must make it his lasting legacy. His spirit must live on in us.
The Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for mourning, never speaks of death but often speaks of peace. In its closing words, may our hearts find a measure of comfort and our souls the eternal touch of hope: Oseh shalom bimromov hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu ve'al kol Yisrael, ve'imru amen. And shalom, chaver."
"June 13, 1995",Remarks at a Memorial Service for Les Aspin,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-les-aspin,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"I would like to begin by thanking all the people who have spoken before. Each of them has given us a little slice of the incredible, complex, rich person that Les was. I think he would have liked this service. I think somewhere he's saying, ""Gee, I guess I did all right.""
I always identified with Les Aspin. We were policy wonks. We sometimes worried more about our workload than our waistlines. And on occasion, we forgot that in this complicated world, how things appear are sometimes almost as important as how things are. But I will never forget that the essence of him was truly extraordinary. And I am in great debt to the contribution he made to my life and to the work of this administration.
One of my favorite pictures that has been in the press since I've been in office is one of Les and I walking across the White House lawn. I had my arm around him, and we looked like we were deep in thought. You know, what I was really telling him is, ""You have to stop working so hard, lose some weight, loosen up."" [ Laughter ] If the Presidency is preeminently a place of the power of persuasion, I failed on that occasion. [ Laughter ]
A friend once described Les' idea of a vacation as thinking about defense in a different setting. [ Laughter ] Once when he did take a few days off, he sent a postcard home to his staff. On the front, there was a picture of a beach; on the back he had scribbled, ""Why are you wasting time reading postcards?""
Those of us who had the privilege of being close to Les Aspin know that he was not only exceptionally brilliant, he was iconoclastic in the best sense. That was a great benefit now as we go through this period of transition from the cold war into a new and exciting but still troubling world.
He was always questioning the conventional wisdom and always refusing to be bound by it. He was a good teacher. I learned a lot from him. I remember the first time I came to see him, I was the Governor of my home State and not a candidate for President, a curious person. And when I left his office after our first talk, I was utterly exhausted. I thought I had finally found somebody with 4 times the energy I have. Through the years, I sought him out more and more. And in 1992, he, more than any other person, was responsible for the fact that in our campaign we determined that both parties would be strong on defense.
Les Aspin did a lot of different things in a lot of different ways. He showed sophistication, and then he showed the lack of it. But, as has been said in different ways today, everyone who really knew him never doubted one thing, that his first and foremost concern was to do whatever would make this country stronger and safer and better. That is what he cared about above all else.
As the cold war wound down, he played a critical role as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. But as my Secretary of Defense, he was finally able to put his remarkable knowledge and passion and vision for defense policy at work to reshape our forces to the demands of the 21st century. The blueprint he took the lead in drafting will guide us into that new world. It will guide us for decades to come. And all of us will be in his debt.
After he left the Defense Department, we continued to talk, and I continued to be amazed by his incredible openness to service, by his incredible passion for the issues with which we were all called upon to deal. And he answered the call to serve again as the head of our Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a post that is not much known outside of Washington but is of profound importance to the future of this country. Then he agreed to serve on the Armed Services Commission on Roles and Missions. He did all these things no matter what else was going on in his life, no matter what had happened to him, with incredible good humor and grace and passionate devotion.
It has been said that true patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion but the steady dedication of a lifetime. By that standard, Les Aspin was a true and remarkable patriot who made a dramatic positive difference to the United States and all the people who live there.
We will miss him terribly, but as you heard today, his legacy remains all around us in the streets of Beloit, Racine, Kenosha, throughout southeast Wisconsin—how he loves that place.
It will be seen in the students and the graduates of Marquette University, in the men and women who wear our uniform around the world and do more good in conditions that are more safe and secure because of his labor.
It also lives on, as we heard today so movingly, in the memories of those of us who were lucky enough to have known and loved him. He left each of us our own stock of Les Aspin stories, guaranteed to bring a smile to our faces and warmth to our hearts as long as we remain on this Earth.
Well, Les is God's servant now. And finally, finally, he is with someone with sufficient energy to keep up. [ Laughter ]"
"February 17, 1995",Remarks at a Memorial Service for J. William Fulbright,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-memorial-service-for-j-william-fulbright,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"Mrs. Fulbright, the children and grandchildren of Senator Fulbright, all of his family and friends here assembled, we come to celebrate and give thanks for the remarkable life of J. William Fulbright, a life that changed our country and our world forever and for the better. In the work he did, the words he spoke, and the life he lived, Bill Fulbright stood against the 20th century's most destructive forces and fought to advance its brightest hopes.
He was the heir of Jefferson in our time. He believed in the American idea, but he respected others who saw the world differently. He lived with passion tempered by reason. He loved politics, but cautioned against the arrogance of power. He cherished education as the answer to our common problems and our personal dreams. But he knew there would always be more to learn.
Time and again for 32 years as a Congressman, a Senator, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he worked for progress and peace, often against great odds and sometimes at great personal cost: expanding opportunities for the people of his beloved Arkansas and other Americans who needed help to make the most of their lives; leading the way to found the United Nations; taking a long, lonely stand against Joseph McCarthy; expanding the reach of our culture as the driving force behind the Kennedy Center; fighting to change our course in Vietnam; reminding us that the forces of freedom would win the cold war if we could avoid nuclear war, what he called his generation's power of veto over the next; and of course, in a cold dawn only 2 weeks after Hiroshima, calling for the creation of the international exchange program that will live as his most profound legacy.
The Fulbright Scholarship Program is a perfect example of Bill Fulbright's faith, different kinds of people learning side by side, building what he called ""a capacity for empathy, a distaste for killing other men, and an inclination for peace."" Next year will be the 50th anniversary of that program. Now it includes as its alumni Nobel Prize winners, Members of Congress, leaders for peace and freedom the world over, and many not so famous people who went home to live out the faith of Senator Fulbright. More than 120,000 from other countries have come here and more than 90,000 Americans have gone overseas to study, to learn, and to grow. No matter what their native tongue, all of them are now known by the same name, Fulbrights.
In a way, a lot of us here, especially those of us from Arkansas and those who worked for him in other ways over the years, are also in our own way Fulbrights. Those of us who knew and loved him, who worked for him, who learned from him, each of us have our indelible memories, some of them serious, some of them quite funny.
I must say that I was a little reluctant to accept the request that I speak today because I once attended a funeral with Bill Fulbright, and I know how much distaste he had for highly formalized rituals. If he were giving me instructions, he'd say, ""Bill, say something nice, be brief, and try to get everybody out so they can enjoy this beautiful day.""
But let me tell you that those of us who understood and shared his roots in the Ozarks, those of us who knew what his life was like as a young person growing up and playing football and becoming the president of a university, those of us who understood later in life what he learned when he had the chance first to travel overseas and study in England and see the insanity that resulted from the squandering of the victory in World War I, those of us who saw firsthand the enormous anguish he felt, as I would see him early in the morning and late in the evening in the Senate office building, in the great struggles over the Vietnam war, those of us who saw him in his campaign in 1968, when this country was being literally torn apart, still trying to learn, trying to understand, and trying to be understood, we will never forget the debt that we owe him and the debt the country owes him.
When Mrs. Fulbright spoke last year in Germany, in recognition of the Senator's receipt of a distinguished award from the American Chamber of Commerce there, she quoted from a letter Senator Fulbright received 30 years ago. I'd like to leave it with you, so that you can remember something of what he did and the times in which he did it.
She said, all this talk of leadership, freedom and education may seem simple, self-evident and commonplace to you now, but there was a time when it was considered radical, even dangerous. Thirty years ago, Senator Fulbright was called names I wouldn't dream of putting on paper, much less pronouncing to a respectable audience. He got emotional letters full of praise and hate. There was one which affected him far more deeply than all the rest. And after reading it, he closed his office doors, ordered all the calls held, and wrote in longhand an answer which he did not copy. I will read you the letter:
""Dear Senator Fulbright: I have never voted for you. I have never missed a chance to belittle you. But deep inside me, there was a nagging suspicion that I have been wrong. As this world plunges headlong toward what well may be its destruction, it gets increasingly harder to hear lonely voices, such as yours, calling for common sense, human reason, and the respect for the brotherhood of man. But be of good cheer, my friend, keep nipping at their heels. This old world has always nailed its prophets to trees, so don't be surprised at those who come at you with hammers and spikes. Know that those multitudes yet unborn will stand on our shoulders. And one among them will stand a little higher because he is standing on yours.""
We owe a lot to Bill Fulbright, some of us more than others. Let us all remember the life he lived and the example he set.
A few years ago, Senator Fulbright came home to Fayetteville, and we celebrated a Fulbright Day. I was then the Governor, and after the official event, we went back to his hotel room and watched the football game. And when the young player for one of the teams kicked a field goal, he looked at me and he said, ""You know, I used to do that over 60 years ago. I don't know what happened to all those years. They sure passed in a hurry."" I think we can all say that they also passed very well.
Senator Fulbright's lesson is captured on the statue in the Fayetteville town square in these quotes: ""In the beauty of these gardens, we honor the beauty of his dream, peace among nations and free exchange of knowledge and ideas across the Earth."" Bill Fulbright also left us the power of his example, always the teacher and always the student.
Thank you, friend, and Godspeed."
"April 27, 1994","Remarks at the Funeral Service for President Richard Nixon in Yorba Linda, California",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-president-richard-nixon-yorba-linda-california,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"President Nixon opened his memoirs with a simple sentence, ""I was born in a house my father built."" Today we can look back at this little house and still imagine a young boy sitting by the window of the attic he shared with his three brothers, looking out to a world he could then himself only imagine. From those humble roots, as from so many humble beginnings in this country, grew the force of a driving dream, a dream that led to the remarkable journey that ends here today where it all began, beside the same tiny home, mail-ordered from back East, near this towering oak tree which, back then, was a mere seedling.
President Nixon's journey across the American landscape mirrored that of his entire nation in this remarkable century. His life was bound up with the striving of our whole people, with our crises and our triumphs.
When he became President, he took on challenges here at home on matters from cancer research to environmental protection, putting the power of the Federal Government where Republicans and Democrats had neglected to put it in the past. In foreign policy, he came to the Presidency at a time in our history when Americans were tempted to say we had had enough of the world. Instead, he knew we had to reach out to old friends and old enemies alike. He would not allow America to quit the world.
Remarkably, he wrote 9 of his 10 books after he left the Presidency, working his way back into the arena he so loved by writing and thinking, and engaging us in his dialog.
For the past year, even in the final weeks of his life, he gave me his wise counsel, especially with regard to Russia. One thing in particular left a profound impression on me.
Though this man was in his ninth decade, he had an incredibly sharp and vigorous and rigorous mind.
As a public man, he always seemed to believe the greatest sin was remaining passive in the face of challenges. And he never stopped living by that creed. He gave of himself with intelligence and energy and devotion to duty. And his entire country owes him a debt of gratitude for that service. Oh yes, he knew great controversy amid defeat as well as victory. He made mistakes, and they, like his accomplishments, are part of his life and record.
But the enduring lesson of Richard Nixon is that he never gave up being part of the action and passion of his times. He said many times that unless a person has a goal, a new mountain to climb, his spirit will die. Well, based on our last phone conversation and the letter he wrote me just a month ago, I can say that his spirit was very much alive to the very end. That is a great tribute to him, to his wonderful wife, Pat, to his children, and to his grandchildren whose love he so depended on and whose love he returned in full measure.
Today is a day for his family, his friends, and his nation to remember President Nixon's life in totality. To them, let us say, may the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a close. May we heed his call to maintain the will and the wisdom to build on America's greatest gift, its freedom, to lead a world full of difficulty to the just and lasting peace he dreamed of.
As it is written in the words of a hymn I heard in my church last Sunday, ""Grant that I may realize that the trifling of life creates differences, but that in the higher things, we are all one."" In the twilight of his life, President Nixon knew that lesson well. It is, I feel certain, a faith he would want us all to keep.
And so, on behalf of all four former Presidents who are here, President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, and on behalf of a grateful nation, we bid farewell to Richard Milhous Nixon."
"April 06, 1994","Remarks at the Funeral Service for William H. Natcher in Bowling Green, Kentucky",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-funeral-service-for-william-h-natcher-bowling-green-kentucky,William J. Clinton,eulogy,"To the family of our friend Bill Natcher; Mr. Congress; all those who have preceded me on Speaker; Governor; distinguished Members of the program: Reverend Welch; Reverend Bridges, thank you for that wonderful sermon; Mr. Orendorf, thank you for making us laugh and for being so wise.
Mr. Speaker, thank you for proving that Reverend Bridges was right, there are still noble and good people in public life in America. Thank you all for making my role almost completely irrelevant. There is hardly anything else left to say.
I think I would like to tell you two things about Bill Natcher from my point of view. The country doesn't work very well in tough times, when difficult decisions have to be made, if the President cannot work with the Congress. We faced an enormously difficult position, Bill Natcher and I did, when I became President and he took the reins of the Appropriations Committee. Our country was drowning in debt, our deficit had been going up, our national debt had tripled in 12 years, and yet every person who studied the issue knew that there were some things we needed to invest even more money in. You heard people talk already today about the National Institute of Health, the need we had to make the changes so that our country could go into the next century and more Bill Natchers would have a chance to make their way in life. We had to find a way to bridle this debt and then invest more in education and in scientific research and in making the transition from a defense to a domestic, hightechnology economy. And all that fell on the shoulders of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
I said to myself—I didn't know Mr. Natcher when I became President. I knew about him; nearly everybody in American politics did. Everybody's asking, ""Can this young guy from Arkansas who has only been a Governor, never been in Congress, be President?"" And I'm saying, ""Can a man who doesn't own a fax machine run the Appropriations Committee?"" [ Laughter ]
Well, let me tell you, he came to see me one day, and we sat alone in the Oval Office, and he almost held my hand, which is just about what I needed. And he said, ""Now, Mr. President""—how many of you heard him say that to you, right—[ laughter ]—""now, we're going to get through this all right, and you're going to make some hard decisions, and I'm going to help you. And then if we're real lucky, we'll get it through the Congress. And you will have to be willing to be misunderstood for a while,"" which I thought was a delicate way of putting the position we were in. [ Laughter ]
But he said, ""The end will bring us out all right."" And sure enough, he set about doing his work. And he worked with all of the Members in the Congress and figured out some way or another to produce a budget that both brought the deficit down and spent more money on things that were critical to our future.
It was a service to the Nation that those of you here in his home district made possible. And it was a remarkable thing, a great gift that he helped to give to our country. And it was very, very hard to do. And I agree with the Speaker: It will affect people's lives in ways that are even more important than the shining example he set by never missing a vote and by being able to be in such harmony with his constituents that he never had to raise money or spend it or campaign or politic in ways that those of us who are more mortal have to do. And I thank him for that.
The other thing I thank him for, which may have an enduring benefit to the country, is far more personal. You heard the Speaker talk about how he was the chairman of the Gym Committee, and they have this dinner every year. And you know, I read all about how I spend too much time at McDonald's, and so I'm always trying to watch my weight in there. But I never wanted to offend Mr. Natcher. So I show up at his dinner, and he takes me to be seated, and he lays a big steak and a baked potato and peach cobbler there. And by the time he got through talking to me, I not only did not offend him, he had talked me into having two of everything. [ Laughter ]
And we talked some more, and our relationship developed some more. And then when he got terribly ill, I went out to Bethesda to see him, and I had the great honor of being there and presented him with the President's Citizens Medal. And I pinned it on his pajamas, and I talked to him about his life.
And I thought to myself: Why is it that I am so moved by this man? What is it that he has done, not just the votes and the no contributions and all that, what is it that he has done that if the rest of us could do it, we could really be true to the Founders of this country, true to the challenges of our time? We could bring more harmony and a stronger sense of community to our people. What is it, exactly?
And I think what it was is that he found a way to live in Washington and work in politics and still be exactly the way he would have been if he'd been here in Bowling Green running a hardware store. And this country works well when people in Washington treat each other the way they would have to treat each other if they were living in Bowling Green. And it doesn't work very well when everybody up there thinks, ""Oh, this is a different place, and we have to treat each other differently, and we have to muscle each other around, and we have to posture rather than produce."" And we're all so worried because we're bound to be misunderstood, being filtered to 250-plus million people, so that all of our positions on complicated issues get simplified and often distorted.
But somehow, Bill Natcher just had enough internal strength and coherence. Maybe he was just enough old-fashioned that he literally was able to live every day as he would have lived if he'd been here all the time. That was the beauty of his legacy. And if the rest of us can remember that about him, even if we miss a few votes or have to go out and raise campaign contributions, if we can just imagine the roots that we had, the childhood friends that we had, who always reminded us of our foibles as well as our strengths, if we can remember what the church choir sounds like on Sunday, even on the Sundays when we don't show up, and every day imagine that we were living where the people who sent us to Washington still live, then we could do something really precious for Bill Natcher. We could do for the American people what he would have done had he lived another 84 years.
God bless you, Mr. Natcher, and thank you."
"October 31, 1987","Remarks at the Memorial Service for Edith Luckett Davis in Phoenix, Arizona",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-service-for-edith-luckett-davis-phoenix-arizona,Ronald Reagan,eulogy,"Father Doran. We want to welcome all of you to St. Thomas the Apostle Parish. In a sense, it's a home parish for Edie, for though she was not a Catholic, she began coming to this parish in 1951, when we were a little barracks built on the back of the property. And she, as a matter of fact, became one of the first benefactors of this parish, where she came one Sunday in the old, cold barracks—and we were sitting on folding chairs—and she said, ""We've got to do something about this parish."" So, she went back up to the Biltmore, and she said, ""There's a bunch of you rich Catholics around here, and you've got to do something for that young, little""—years ago-""young, little priest that is trying to build a parish. Now, I'm going to give a bingo game Sunday night, and you're going to come, and you're going to dish out."" And thus it happened. When she said something, it happened. And she came down the next day very gleefully with a pocket—or, with a bagful of money that she had made for the parish that night.
So, that was her beginning here, and it carried on. As the parish grew, she continued to be a part of it. And one day about 18 years ago, when Edie wasn't feeling particularly well at that time, Loyal got me aside, and he said, ""Father, you've got to make a promise to me."" I said, ""What?"" He said, ""When Edie dies, you've got to bury her, and you've got to bury her down in that church, where she's been going all these years."" So, we are fulfilling a promise. And Nancy and I looked at each other the other night, and we said, ""We're fulfilling a promise to Edie. We're also fulfilling a promise to Loyal.""
So, it is very appropriate that you join with us today, as we say a very happy word of memory to a very happy person. So, we continue now.
Monsignor Donohoe. From Edie's own little Bible, loaned me for this occasion by her precious daughter, we read one of Mrs. Davis' favorite prayers.
""The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."" These are the words of Holy Scripture.
Father Doran. Over many years of priesthood, 22 of which were spent in this parish, I came to know a great number of people, naturally. And I came to build a habit of—when I was saying a few words at their funeral service—of trying to pick out some particular aspect of that person, something that perhaps gave the key to that person's personality. And what I always wanted to do was to choose something that her friends and her family and all who knew her would sit back and say, ""Yes, that's right. That's true of him. That's true of her."" It was a way of seeking a truth of a person and have it verified by the family and the friends.
So, we looked to the center aspect of Edie Davis, something that would be singular about her. And I think her family and you, her friends, will agree that if you wanted one word to describe Edie Davis it would be ""delightful."" She was a delightful person. One felt delight in her presence. One felt delight in the anticipation of her presence. One found delight in the memory of her presence. For that is the way of Edie Davis in her life and to all those around her. She reminded me of what a poetess had said: ""She walks, the lady of my delight."" And that is what I saw, and I have a feeling what you saw, in this lovely woman.
Now, it might be interesting to consider for a moment just what is delight. If you were asked to describe the word ""delight,"" how would you put it? What would you say of it? It's a strange thing that delight is curiously human and intensely intellectual. We experience delight first with our minds. We feel it is not so much a pleasure of the senses as it is a delight of the mind at something that another has said or something that another has done that gives pleasure, delight to those around, to those who hear, to those who experience. So true is this that sometimes, though we're reluctant to admit it, we can be delighted in ourselves at something we have said or something that we feel was particularly good that we might have done. Delight—delight is a reaction. It's a vibration responding to the wisdom or the wit or the outright humor of another person, of the vibrations of that reaching our mind like a spark coming out and igniting a fire of warmth within us.
One couldn't be with Edie Davis for a few minutes, or one couldn't be with Edie Davis for a long time, without experiencing the effulgence of delight which came from her presence or which came from hearing her witty, fun-filled reactions to the vagaries and the varieties of human life. She could turn a formal occasion into a fun-filled occasion with one simple phrase. I remember one time I introduced her to our first Bishop of Phoenix, and she met him very formally, almost curtsied to him. And then she turned to me, and she said, ""Well, aren't you and I going to kiss? We always do when the Bishop isn't here""— [laughter] —a typical Edie remark.
She could come back at you. She could answer you in a flash. She called me one time late in a week and asked if I could come for dinner on Saturday night. I said, ""I'm not really sure. Let me check."" She said, ""You have to come. You have to come."" And I said, ""Why do I have to come?"" She said, ""The Governor of California is coming over for dinner tonight, and I've got to let Ronnie know I've got some decent friends."" [Laughter]
People who knew Edie for a short time began to love her for her warmth, her wit, and her delightful character. One time, she and Loyal turned over their house for what we called, in this parish, a holiday house. People of the parish had made all sorts of things for holiday sale. And we would decorate a house, and it would be an open house for anyone to come. Well, several of the ladies were up there early, getting the house ready, and they came out just simply bubbling at Edie Davis. And then, on the following day when anybody could go through, she stood there almost the whole day long as the great hostess. And over and over again, people coming out remarked, ""What a wonderful woman this is. What a delight!"" That word was used so often-""What a delight to meet her or to know her.""
And so, may I say to the family and to you friends the assurance that something special is in delight in the very eyes of God. You know, God made us humans the only creatures who can laugh. The animals don't laugh, even the angels don't laugh—only humans. It's our human characteristic. And so, we have this power of laughter and of joy and of delight in the grandeur or the lovability or the wit or the wisdom of another. And this gift of God was intended to lighten our days, to make them lighter and brighter by the delight that we see in others. And that same God—I think I can assure you, Nancy—that same God who gave us this power rejoices in our use of that power and certainly will smile benignly at one who used that power with such graciousness and such generosity, who gave delight to others through these many, many years of her life; because there's an old saying—I think it's an Indian saying, but I'm not sure—and it says this: ""Laughter is music to the ears of God."" And she played a song of music in her life and will have it now. God bless you.
Monsignor Donohoe. In this day of thanksgiving for heritage—heritage for her family and, through the providence of God, heritage for our nation—we go back to the Book of Ecclesiastes and read this passage for ourselves as we go on our pilgrimage to join Edie in heaven.
""To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heavens; a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build up; a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing; a time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to cast away; a time to reap and a time to sow; a time to keep silence and a time to speak; a time to love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?""
Thus ends the words of this passage.
The President. How do we say goodbye to someone we've loved for so long, someone of innate tenderness who loved us? Indeed, she loved all humankind. We all have our memories, precious memories. I became acquainted with Deedie by telephone. When Nancy and I were courting, if she were calling her mother or her mother calling her and I was there, she—well, she introduced me to Deedie on the phone. And then she would put me on the phone to visit for a while. And it was quite a time before we met face-to-face, but when we did we were already close friends.
To paraphrase Winston Churchill, meeting her was ""like opening a bottle of champagne."" Nancy and I spent our honeymoon with Deedie and Loyal here in Arizona. And after getting to know her and after a period of that kind together, I have to tell you I have never been able to tell a mother-in-law story or joke since. Somerset Maugham wrote a line that could have been for her: ""When you have loved as she has loved, you grow old beautifully.""
Many people who only knew about Deedie will remember her as the lady who headed up the great fund-raising charity in Chicago for 25 years. Many more will remember her for all that she did here in Phoenix, raising millions of dollars, particularly for children who were disabled or handicapped. But there are countless more individuals who will remember her for what she did for them, personally, when they had a problem or a trouble or something that made them need help. She didn't just recognize the cop on the corner; they were personal friends. She knew countless other people who just crossed her path-delivery boys, the cleaning woman, Dr. Loyal's patients, and, yes, his students in the medical school at Northwestern University.
My first inkling of how well she was known and loved came some years ago when, at that time, my television sponsor had brought me to Chicago to appear at a kind of forum. It ran late, and I came out; it was dark. And I was supposed to meet Deedie and Loyal. They had told me the name of the cafe, and I was to meet them for dinner. And I told the doorman about this and that I needed some instructions as to where was that cafe. And was it far enough away that I needed transportation? And in doing so, I, without realizing it, I told him who I was meeting. And he just raised his hand when I said that name. And he left me and went out to the curb, and he started looking, I suppose, for a cab. But the traffic was stopped for the stoplight on the corner, and there was a police car. And he waved the police car over to the curb, and he told them about me and who I was meeting and that I needed to get there. And the next thing I knew, I was a passenger in a police car with two officers who knew Deedie Davis and who drove me right to the door as quickly as they could.
On another occasion, Nancy and I were coming into Chicago on the overnight train from New York, getting in early in the morning in the midst of a blizzard. And there wasn't a redcap in sight. The porters on the cars took the luggage off and sat it down there on the ramp. We were quite a ways from the station. In that blizzard, and all up and down the train, were all the passengers trying to sort out the luggage and trying to find their own bags. And Nancy and I looked up, and coming down the ramp was Deedie, arm in arm with two redcaps. [Laughter] They were having quite a conversation. And as they got closer, I heard she was talking to one about his daughter, and by name. She knew his daughter, also, and how was she getting along in school? And by that time, they were close to us. And Deedie said, ""Oh, this is my son and daughter. Could you help them with their luggage?"" And so the five of us went back up the ramp. And now Edie was arm in arm with both of us, and the two redcaps were carrying our baggage past hundreds of passengers who had no such help. I remembered one thing that I've never forgotten. She said to her two friends when they caught up with us that I was her son and Nancy her daughter. She didn't say son-in-law.
She gave wit and charm and kindliness throughout all of her life. She also raised a son who was a respected surgeon, an honorable man, caring father, and husband. And she gave the world a loving daughter, a woman who has made my life complete.
In the midst of our grief, Dick and Nancy, I hope you'll take comfort from this: that you were loving children, and you made Deedie happy and very proud. Yes, all of us who are gathered here feel great sorrow. But let's be sure we know the sorrow is for ourselves, for the loss that we now feel. But let us realize that Deedie has just gone through a door from this life to that other life that God promised us, that life that is eternal, where no one is old, where there's no pain or sorrow, and where she is a smiling and loving Deedie we all remember, now once again hand in hand with Loyal, surrounded by others of her loved ones who have preceded her there.
And she's looking back on us with that loving kindness. Yes, she's here. She's seeing us and hearing us now. She's wanting us to be happy in knowing that one day, we will all be together again. And if I know Deedie, that other life that we've been promised will even be better, because she's been there for a while before we arrived."
"July 29, 1987",Remarks at the Memorial Service Honoring Malcolm Baldrige,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-service-honoring-malcolm-baldrige,Ronald Reagan,eulogy,"Midge, Megan, Molly, distinguished ladies and gentlemen: The day I called Mac Baldrige to ask him to join the Cabinet, I was told by Midge I would have to call back later. He was out on his horse roping and couldn't come to the phone. Right then I knew he was the kind of man I wanted.
It's a gift to be simple, we're told. If that means to hold simple, strong, and decent values, Mac had that gift. You could see it in the way he moved around the White House. He seemed to know everyone, not just those in the public eye but the secretaries and assistants, as well. And he treated everyone with the same measure of courtesy and respect, from his driver to the President. He never judged a man or woman by rank or trappings. Despite his many remarkable successes, worldly success was not the way he measured people. No, money was not, position was not, qualities of character were. Honesty, courage, industry, and humility—these were his yardsticks. And if you had these simple qualities, you'd made it in his eyes, whether you were rich or poor, famous or unknown.
Language was one way he decided if you were his kind of person. It's well known now that he insisted on simple language in memos at the Commerce Department. He banned phrases that were vague or redundant. He once said that the thing he liked about cowboys was that they didn't talk unless they had something to say, and when they said something, they meant it. To him, simple language did not mark a simple mind, but a strong and fearless one. It was a sign of those who didn't hide their meaning behind a cloud of ambiguous words.
Mac, of course, never hid his opinions. Even if the tide was against him, he was forceful and clear and unflinching. I always knew where he stood, and so did the country. I could always count on him for the truth as he saw it, no matter how unpleasant or unpopular. There were times the Cabinet came down on an issue 12 to 1, and he was on the short end. But I knew that if he believed something that others didn't he wouldn't reign himself in and follow the herd. He would step forward and be clear.
What I'm saying about Mac Baldrige adds up to a simple but extraordinary quality that I would call, more than anything else, American. In his directness, in his honesty, in his independence, in his disregard for rank, in his courage, he embodied the best of the American spirit. I suppose we think of that spirit as living most of all in cowboys. And that's why I've always suspected that it was more than just roping and his place here in Washington that got Mac voted into the Cowboy Hall of Fame. He belonged there. It was in his blood. It was in his heart and soul.
Let me say a word about his many contributions to his country. These were not simple, although they were built on simple principles, principles like his reverence for the independence of the American character, for the freedom that lets independence flourish, and for the opportunities of a free society. Mac was an architect of American international economic policy during years in which that policy moved to center stage. He also helped shape our policy towards East-West trade in a period in which that was a source of new questions and concerns. And perhaps the least recognized of his major achievements was the securing of trade ties with China. In just 4 years since his 1983 visit to China, trade has become a pillar of the Sino-American relationship.
To contribute so much required skill and persistence—qualities Mac had in abundance. It also required vision, vision not only for dealing with immediate issues but for the future of the entire world and its economy, as well. I always prized the quality of Mac's vision. He had the capacity to look up from the dust of the plains to the distant mountains. He never forgot that all the skirmishes and battles over trade policy that we have here in Washington and around the world have one final goal: We're building a world in which our children and grandchildren will live. And we who love freedom and revere the dignity of humanity have a sacred duty to make that an open world of real hope and abundant opportunity, a world in which the spirit of freedom-yes, what you might call that part of the American spirit that lives in all of mankind—in which that spirit can ride across an open range towards the peaks beyond.
I'm told that Mac's staff had orders to interrupt him at whatever time of the day with calls from only two people. I was one, and any cowboy who rang up was the other. Well, I'm honored to have been in that company. Mac, as we know, left us while he was doing what he loved most. And now, whenever any of us wants to ring him up, we'll have to remind ourselves that he's out on a horse somewhere, and we'll just have to wait. Yet in his simplicity, he has entered the company of the men and women who have shaped our nation and its destiny, and he will live in that company forever.
Yes, there is sorrow, but the sorrow is with us and for us. We must believe that door is opened that God promised and he has just gone through that door into another life, where there is no more pain, no more sorrow. And we must believe that we, too, will one day go through that door and join him again. Thank you. God bless you."
"January 31, 1986","Remarks at the Memorial Service for the Crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger in Houston, Texas",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-service-for-the-crew-the-space-shuttle-challenger-houston-texas,Ronald Reagan,eulogy,"We come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans, to share the grief that we all feel, and, perhaps in that sharing, to find the strength to bear our sorrow and the courage to look for the seeds of hope. Our nation's loss is first a profound personal loss to the family and the friends and the loved ones of our shuttle astronauts. To those they left behind—the mothers, the fathers, the husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, yes, and especially the children—all of America stands beside you in your time of sorrow.
What we say today is only an inadequate expression of what we carry in our hearts. Words pale in the shadow of grief; they seem insufficient even to measure the brave sacrifice of those you loved and we so admired. Their truest testimony will not be in the words we speak, but in the way they led their lives and in the way they lost their lives—with dedication, honor, and an unquenchable desire to explore this mysterious and beautiful universe.
The best we can do is remember our seven astronauts, our Challenger Seven, remember them as they lived, bringing life and love and joy to those who knew them and pride to a nation. They came from all parts of this great country—from South Carolina to Washington State; Ohio to Mohawk, New York; Hawaii to North Carolina to Concord, New Hampshire. They were so different; yet in their mission, their quest, they held so much in common.
We remember Dick Scobee, the commander who spoke the last words we heard from the space shuttle Challenger. He served as a fighter pilot in Vietnam earning many medals for bravery and later as a test pilot of advanced aircraft before joining the space program. Danger was a familiar companion to Commander Scobee.
We remember Michael Smith, who earned enough medals as a combat pilot to cover his chest, including the Navy Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air Medals, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star in gratitude from a nation he fought to keep free.
We remember Judith Resnik, known as J.R. to her friends, always smiling, always eager to make a contribution, finding beauty in the music she played on her piano in her off-hours.
We remember Ellison Onizuka, who as a child running barefoot through the coffee fields and macadamia groves of Hawaii dreamed of someday traveling to the Moon. Being an Eagle Scout, he said, had helped him soar to the impressive achievements of his career.
We remember Ronald McNair, who said that he learned perseverance in the cotton fields of South Carolina. His dream was to live aboard the space station, performing experiments and playing his saxophone in the weightlessness of space. Well, Ron, we will miss your saxophone; and we will build your space station.
We remember Gregory Jarvis. On that ill-fated flight he was carrying with him a flag of his university in Buffalo, New York—a small token, he said, to the people who unlocked his future.
We remember Christa McAuliffe, who captured the imagination of the entire Nation; inspiring us with her pluck, her restless spirit of discovery; a teacher, not just to her students but to an entire people, instilling us all with the excitement of this journey we ride into the future.
We will always remember them, these skilled professionals, scientists, and adventurers, these artists and teachers and family men and women; and we will cherish each of their stories, stories of triumph and bravery, stories of true American heroes. On the day of the disaster, our nation held a vigil by our television sets. In one cruel moment our exhilaration turned to horror; we waited and watched and tried to make sense of what we had seen. That night I listened to a call-in program on the radio; people of every age spoke of their sadness and the pride they felt in our astronauts.
Across America we are reaching out, holding hands, and finding comfort in one another. The sacrifice of your loved ones has stirred the soul of our nation and through the pain our hearts have been opened to a profound truth: The future is not free; the story of all human progress is one of a struggle against all odds. We learned again that this America, which Abraham Lincoln called the last, best hope of man on Earth, was built on heroism and noble sacrifice. It was built by men and women like our seven star voyagers, who answered a call beyond duty, who gave more than was expected or required, and who gave it little thought to worldly reward.
We think back to the pioneers of an earlier century, the sturdy souls who took their families and their belongings and set out into the frontier of the American West. Often they met with terrible hardship. Along the Oregon Trail, you could still see the grave markers of those who fell on the way, but grief only steeled them to the journey ahead. Today the frontier is space and the boundaries of human knowledge. Sometimes when we reach for the stars, we fall short. But we must pick ourselves up again and press on despite the pain. Our nation is indeed fortunate that we can still draw on immense reservoirs of courage, character, and fortitude; that we're still blessed with heroes like those of the space shuttle Challenger.
Dick Scobee knew that every launching of a space shuttle is a technological miracle. And he said, ""If something ever does go wrong, I hope that doesn't mean the end to the space shuttle program."" Every family member I talked to asked specifically that we continue the program, that that is what their departed loved one would want above all else. We will not disappoint them. Today we promise Dick Scobee and his crew that their dream lives on, that the future they worked so hard to build will become reality. The dedicated men and women of NASA have lost seven members of their family. Still, they, too, must forge ahead with a space program that is effective, safe, and efficient, but bold and committed. Man will continue his conquest of space. To reach out for new goals and ever greater achievements—that is the way we shall commemorate our seven Challenger heroes.
Dick, Mike, Judy, El, Ron, Greg, and Christa—your families and your country mourn your passing. We bid you goodbye; we will never forget you. For those who knew you well and loved you, the pain will be deep and enduring. A nation, too, will long feel the loss of her seven sons and daughters, her seven good friends. We can find consolation only in faith, for we know in our hearts that you who flew so high and so proud now make your home beyond the stars, safe in God's promise of eternal life.
May God bless you all and give you comfort in this difficult time."
"May 09, 1980",Eulogy at the National Memorial Service for American Servicemen Killed in Iran,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-the-national-memorial-service-for-american-servicemen-killed-iran,Jimmy Carter,eulogy,"It's difficult not to say ""amen.""
We come here today to honor eight courageous men and to share in some small way the burden of the grief of their loved ones. When I approached the meeting, shortly before this ceremony began, with the families of those who have lost their lives, I did it with some degree of concern and trepidation. But as I approached them, every one, and we put our arms around each other, invariably they said, ""God bless you, Mr. President. We are proud, Mr. President,"" and either Richard or Harold or Lynn or Charles or Joel or John or Dewey or George were ""honored to serve their country.""
But even for those of us who know that God has a purpose for each human life, it's hard to accept the loss of these brave young men in the very peak of their life and their career. Yet we know that it is not the length of a life that determines its impact or its meaning or its quality, but the depth of its commitment and the height of its purpose.
They came from California, Connecticut, Tennessee, Arkansas, Florida, Virginia; two were Georgians, from Dublin and Valdosta.
They did not ask for recognition. They only asked for an opportunity to serve, often at a sacrifice and under very difficult conditions, far from the people they loved and often very distant from the very civilization which they were sworn and committed to protect. They chose a life of military service at a time when it offered very little glory in their land, when their award had to come from knowing that they had done a necessary and a dangerous job and done it well.
They volunteered for this mission knowing its importance, and they also knew its risks. They did so not because they cared too little for life—they wanted to live it out to a full old age—but they did it because they cared so much for the lives of our hostages and for the right of our people to enjoy the freedom for which this Nation was formed.
It's fitting that we should remember them here in this place where Americans have long paid tribute to those who died for our country—those who were known and honored, those who were unknown; those who lie in unmarked graves, even across the sea, and those who are buried here. This very land once belonged to General Robert E. Lee. Like these eight men, he was a soldier whose affection for his home and family called him to a life of service that often meant hardship, loneliness, and long separation from those he loved and even from the Nation which. he most loved.
Robert E. Lee lived by the words that he wrote to his own son: ""Duty is the sublimest word in our language. Do your duty in all things. You cannot do more. You should never wish to do less."" The airmen and marines we are honoring today demonstrated by their lives and finally by their deaths that they understood and subscribed to that austere and honorable creed.
The strength of our Nation has always lain in the ability of individual Americans to do what we must, each of us, each day, whatever our particular duty is. For the men we honor today, duty required both daring and quiet courage. They were willing to face the relentless desert and the angry mobs, if necessary, to free fellow Americans who can be accused of doing nothing more than their own duty in a hostile place.
We stand here today, surrounded by the graves of succeeding generations of Americans who performed their duty in the unending struggle to preserve our peace and our freedom. Like those who've gone before, these young men died to keep that ancient dream of human liberty alive. If we are to honor our dead, we must do it with our own lives. We must defend that same dream with all the strength and all the wisdom and all the courage that we can muster.
I speak for all Americans when I say to those who anonymously risk their lives each day to keep the peace and to maintain our military strength, and to the loved ones of those who died on the Iranian desert: Your risk, your suffering, your loss, are not in vain. I fervently pray that those who are still held hostage will be freed without more bloodshed, that all those who would use terror to impel innocent people will see the cruel futility of their criminal acts.
To the families of the eight who died and to those who were injured, I extend the heartfelt sympathy of a proud and a grateful nation. Every American feels your loss. Every American shares your rightful pride in the valor and the dedication to duty of those who died in that dark desert night. Of such men as yours was our beloved country made, and of them is our beloved country preserved in freedom."
"June 03, 1979",Remarks at the Memorial Services for Civil Rights Leader A. Philip Randolph,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-services-for-civil-rights-leader-philip-randolph,Jimmy Carter,eulogy,"The President of the United States has many invitations to speak, a thousand invitations for each one that I can accept. But when I heard about this memorial for A. Philip Randolph, I did not hesitate. I told my staff to cancel my other requests, and I wanted to be here personally.
I've had a chance to know some of the people who have already spoken. Bayard Rustin's words moved me deeply. And as I listened to him and thought about our country, I realized even more vividly that we are in a time of change, of doubt, of fear, of division, of uncertainty. When standards are transient and when we seek as individual human beings for some life which can inspire us, I doubt that there is a mother or a father in this Nation who, knowing A. Philip Randolph and what he was, would not want our sons and daughters to be like him.
It's not an accident that Mr. Rustin and the other members of his brotherhood called him ""The Chief."" That didn't mean that he was a domineering master, that he imposed his will on others, that he was an autocratic driver of those who worked under him and who looked to him for leadership. It meant that he was an object of admiration, of respect, even perhaps, of reverence.
When there was hardly any detectable civil rights movement in our country back in 1941, A. Philip Randolph led the march on Washington. As has been pointed out, he was scorned by those in power. And he was even feared somewhat by those who were oppressed, because his strong voice might create some disturbance in their own quiet lives if their own rights were pushed forward too loudly and too strongly. But he was not deterred.
He was a man of dignity; he was a man of tenacity; he was a man of eloquence; and he was a man of gentleness and of constant idealism. But the words ""gentleness"" and ""idealism"" don't quite describe what A. Philip Randolph was, because he was able to combine idealism with hard work and sweat.
He was a working man. His father was a tailor and a preacher. And he combined gentleness with kind of a brash courage in a time when it was not done. He stood up strongly, face to face, with four great Presidents: Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy— not seeking publicity, not seeking a confrontation, but because he believed in a principle so deeply that he was not at all fearful or timid about a confrontation with the highest elected official of our country.
His struggle was not easy, but the victories he won were permanent, steps that seemed to be small. And one of the reasons for their permanence as building blocks for the future was that he did not leave behind him a battlefield of bitterness.
His own personal character assuaged the feelings of those who confronted him on the opposite side of an argument and lost. They accepted the judgment that was rendered when A. Philip Randolph won his important victories.
He was a man who studied Shakespeare-not to show that he was highly educated or erudite, not to learn how human beings can move like chameleons on and off the stage life with constantly changing principles and ideals and commitments, but he studied Shakespeare so that he could learn the constant truths of the human soul.
I found a passage from Shakespeare that I think might be appropriate, and I'd like to read it. It's just two lines. ""Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine, his honor and the greatness of his name shall be""—and a very strange but pertinent ending—""and shall make new nations.""
""Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine, his honor and the greatness of his name shall be and shall make new nations.""
It would not be appropriate to take away from many others, some in this church, credit for the achievements of the last few years or decades. But I don't think there's any doubt that A. Philip Randolph contributed to the making of a new nation—not a perfect nation, not a nation worthy of maintaining the status quo, but a nation of struggle which has observed progress and which recognizes that progress still remains to be made because we live in a society even here in the United States where inequality and hatred, deprivation and hunger, racism, still exist.
But I think that A. Philip Randolph and his life exemplified one additional truth that I'd like to say. Institutions, governments set as goals material progress: opening up the West, the expansion of our Nation, increase in gross national product, achievements of which chambers of commerce can be proud in individual cities. Those kinds of evidence of progress are supported by a wide range of institutions and organizations that mutually benefit from them. But social progress-equality, liberty, freedom, justice—that kind of progress comes rarely from government as the initiator; it almost invariably comes from a courageous human being whose fellow workers might call him the Chief.
We have a great nation. It can be much greater if we never forget the life and the times and the constant presence in our lives of the Chief."
"January 16, 1978","Eulogy Delivered at the Funeral Services for Hubert H. Humphrey in St. Paul, Minnesota",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-delivered-the-funeral-services-for-hubert-h-humphrey-st-paul-minnesota,Jimmy Carter,eulogy,"Not too long ago I invited Senator Humphrey to go to Camp David to spend the weekend with me. He had never been there before, and he was very effusive in his thanks, telling me over and over how great a favor I had done for him. It was the greatest favor I ever did for myself.
We spent 2 days on top of a mountain, in front of a fireplace, just talking and listening. We talked about people—common, ordinary people and great people in our country and all around the world. With some he had had very friendly and good relations. They had always supported him in his campaign and always had good things to say about him. Others had sometimes disappointed him, and he had not always had their support. But he never said a word of criticism. He tried to search in his own mind, no matter who it was, and find something good to say.
We talked about pain, about the physical pain that I could see that he was bearing. We talked about the pain of losing a political campaign. We talked about the pain of frustration when you have high hopes and great dreams and human fallibilities won't let you realize them all. But I never detected in any of his words any bitterness.
Yesterday I was honored to speak about Hubert Humphrey at the Nation's Capitol. I talked about what he had meant to our own Nation. But he knew, as I know and Vice President Mondale knows, that one of the responsibilities of those who serve in the White House is to look beyond our Nation's borders, to foreign countries. He traveled a lot, and he told me about the world leaders with whom he had met. He told me about the months during the Vietnam war when he was Vice President and how when he rode down the streets or got off the airplane or visited a college campus with his heart full of love, quite often he didn't see love in the faces of the crowds who faced him, and he didn't see love on the signs and the banners that confronted him and his President. He had a yearning for peace, and we talked about the mechanisms of peace—not always a popular subject for a political figure in a nation as proud of its military strength and its great influence. But in kind of a quiet and unpublicized way, because of what was in him, he was the expression of the good and decent and peaceful attributes of our great, strong, powerful Nation.
He was always dedicated to breaking the logjams in the cold war. He expressed a deep hope that we and the Soviet Union might reach agreements on difficult questions and resolve longstanding differences and get to know each other and search for a way to reduce the mad scramble for superiority in nuclear weapons.
We talked about the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, set up now to negotiate how we might reduce and perhaps eliminate atomic weapons, and I discovered almost by accident that the author of that legislation was Hubert Humphrey.
We talked about the sale of military weapons to other nations, particularly the poor nations, the developing nations, the hungry nations, who respond to the temptations of technological progress and the threats from border states and come to us, above all others, and other nations as well, to buy guns and ammunition to kill.
We are trying to change that policy, and we talked about it and the mechanism under which we are trying to reduce our own participation in the marketing of weapons. It's his legislation.
One of the most difficult questions that a President has to face, or even a Member of Congress, is foreign aid. It's not popular in our country to be for foreign aid programs. But one of the stalwart defenders of our foreign aid program, the leader in the Congress, was Hubert Humphrey. He didn't see foreign aid as a giveaway program. He didn't see foreign aid as billions of dollars going from our Nation to others. He saw human needs.
We talked about the sick people that he had seen overseas, with no medical care at all, and the unbelievable hunger that he had seen in families where the average income for a whole nation was sometimes less than 25 cents a person a day.
So, he saw foreign aid as a great investment from a rich nation, a pittance almost, compared to what we earn and have, that builds up a wellspring of friendship between us and those hungry people.
We talked about the newly developing interest in our own Government toward Africa, not more than a year or two old, but it was not new to Hubert Humphrey. He was familiar with Africa, the nations therein, the people who live there, their hopes and yearnings and frustrations and desire to be something and to have their own governments. He knew about Asia, and he knew about Indonesia, and he talked about these things, not as a lecturer, but almost as a representative of those people, not just Minnesota. He reached beyond our borders.
It was a long time after my mother went to the Peace Corps that I knew that the Peace Corps was Hubert Humphrey's idea. It was an idea that he put forward a long time ago, and it was eventually adopted and put into effect when John Kennedy was President, an opportunity for American young people to go overseas for, I think, $11 a month and get to know other people and serve them. And along with Senator McGovern, he initiated the idea of the Food for Peace program.
He and I talked about religion, about how deep his faith had grown since he became very ill. We talked about sin and how we know that everyone sins and we fall short of the glory of God, but how God forgives us.
Just a few days ago I was in India, and I was visiting the tomb—or the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, where his body was cremated. And I didn't think about Senator Humphrey—I have to admit it-until I started to leave. And one of the Indian leaders took me over to a wall, and there on the wall there was a quote from Gandhi and the title of it was, ""The Seven Sins."" And when I saw that, I thought about Senator Humphrey's discussion on sin, and I jotted it down.
According to Gandhi, the seven sins are wealth without works, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity, worship without sacrifice, and politics without principle.
Well, Hubert Humphrey may have sinned in the eyes of God, as we all do, but according to those definitions of Gandhi's, it was Hubert Humphrey without sin."
"January 15, 1978",Remarks at the Memorial Services for Hubert H. Humphrey at the Capitol,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-services-for-hubert-h-humphrey-the-capitol,Jimmy Carter,eulogy,"At critical times in our history, the United States has been blessed by great people who, just by being themselves, give us a vision of what we are at our best and of what we might become. Hubert Humphrey was such a man.
In a time of impending social crisis, 30 years ago, his was the first voice I ever heard, a lone voice, persistently demanding basic human rights for all Americans. It was the most difficult moral and social issue that my own generation would have to face. In those early days, his was a clear voice, a strong voice, a passionate voice which recruited others to join in a battle in our own country so that equal rights of black people could be gained to vote, to hold a job, to go to school, to own a home.
I first met Hubert Humphrey when he was Vice President—torn because his heart was filled with love and a yearning for peace, while at the same time he was meticulously loyal to a President who led our Nation during an unpopular war.
I also remember him in a time of political defeat, courageously leading a divided Democratic Party, losing his uphill campaign for President by just a few votes. But he was a big man, and without bitterness he gave his support to the new President, and then came back later to the Senate to serve his Nation once again.
For the last year of his life I knew him best, and that's when I needed him most. Despite campaign disagreements and my own harsh words spoken under pressure and in haste, it was not his nature to forget how to love or to forgive.
He has given me freely what I need-the support and understanding of a close and true friend, the advice of a wise and honest counselor.
When he first visited me in the Oval Office, I felt that he should have served there. I know that he's been an inspiration and a conscience to us all, but especially to the leaders of our Nation—to Harry Truman, to Dwight Eisenhower, to John Kennedy, to Lyndon Johnson, to Richard Nixon, to Gerald Ford, and to me. We and our families are here today to testify that Hubert Humphrey may well have blessed our country more than any of us.
His greatest personal attribute was that he really knew how to love. There was nothing abstract or remote about it. He did not love humanity only in the mass. You could feel it in the scope of his concern, in his words, in the clasp of his hands, in the genuine, eager interest in his eyes as he looked at you.
He always spoke up for the weak and the hungry and for the victims of discrimination and poverty. He never lost sight of our own human possibilities. He never let us forget that in our democratic Nation we are a family, bound together by a kinship of purpose and by mutual concern and respect. He reminded us that we must always protect and nurture the other members of our national family.
Yesterday, as messages poured in to me as President and to the members of the Humphrey family from throughout the world, I realized vividly that Hubert Humphrey was the most beloved of all Americans, and that his family encompassed not just the people of the United States but of all people everywhere.
He asked, as the Vice President has said, that this service be a celebration, and in a way that's what it is. Even as we mourn his death, we celebrate because such a man as Hubert Humphrey was among us. The joy of his memory will last far longer than the pain and sorrow of his leaving."
"May 04, 1972",Eulogy Delivered at Funeral Services for J. Edgar Hoover,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-delivered-funeral-services-for-j-edgar-hoover,Richard Nixon,eulogy,"Dr. Elson, Mrs. Eisenhower, Your Excellencies from the diplomatic corps, my fellow Americans:
Today is a day of sadness for America, but it is also a day of pride. America's pride has always been its people, a people of good men and women by the millions, of great men and women in remarkable numbers, and, once in a long while, of giants who stand head and shoulders above their countrymen, setting a high and noble standard for us all.
J. Edgar Hoover was one of the giants. His long life brimmed over with magnificent achievement and dedicated service to this country which he loved so well. One of the tragedies of life is that, as a rule, a man's true greatness is recognized only in death. J. Edgar Hoover was one of the rare exceptions to that rule. He became a living legend while still a young man, and he lived up to his legend as the decades passed. His death only heightens the respect and admiration felt for him across this land and in every land where men cherish freedom.
The greatness of Edgar Hoover will remain inseparable from the greatness of the organization he created and gave his whole life to building, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He made the FBI the finest law enforcement agency on the earth, the invincible and incorruptible defender of every American's precious right to be free from fear.
Yet, America has revered this man not only as the Director of an institution but as an institution in his own right. For nearly half a century, nearly one-fourth of the whole history of this Republic, J. Edgar Hoover has exerted a great influence for good in our national life. While eight Presidents came and went, while other leaders of morals and manners and opinion rose and fell, the Director stayed at his post.
I recall that President Eisenhower, a Republican, and President Johnson, a Democrat, both strongly recommended, after my election, that I keep him as Director of the FBI.
He was one of those unique individuals who, by all odds, was the best man for a vitally important job. His powerful leadership by example helped to keep steel in America's backbone, and the flame of freedom in America's soul.
He personified integrity; he personified honor; he personified principle; he personified courage; he personified discipline; he personified dedication; he personified loyalty; he personified patriotism.
These are his legacies to the Bureau he built and the Nation he served. We can pay him no higher tribute than to live these virtues ourselves, as he lived them all of his years, to love the law as he loved it, and to give fullest respect, support, and cooperation to the law enforcement profession which he did so much to advance.
When such a towering figure--a man who has dominated his field so completely for so many years--finally passes from the scene, there is sometimes a tendency to say, ""Well, this is an end of an era.""
There is a belief that a changing of the guard will also mean a changing of the rules. With J. Edgar Hoover this will not happen. The FBI will carry on in the future, true to its finest traditions in the past, because regardless of what the snipers and detractors would have us believe, the fact is that Director Hoover built the Bureau totally on principle, not on personality. He built well. He built to last. For that reason, the FBI will remain as a memorial to him, a living memorial, continuing to create a climate of protection, security, and impartial justice that benefits every American.
The good J. Edgar Hoover has done will not die. The profound principles associated with his name will not fade away. Rather, I would predict that in the time ahead those principles of respect for law, order, and justice will come to govern our national life more completely than ever before. Because the trend of permissiveness in this country, a trend which Edgar Hoover fought against all his life, a trend which was dangerously eroding our national heritage as a law-abiding people, is now being reversed.
The American people today are tired of disorder, disruption, and disrespect for law. America wants to come back to the law as a way of life, and as we do come back to the law, the memory of this great man, who never left the law as a way of life, will be accorded even more honor than it commands today.
In times past, in the days of the American frontier, the brave men who wore the badge and enforced the law were called by a name we do not often hear today. They were called peace officers. Today, though that term has passed out of style, the truth it expressed still endures. All the world yearns for peace, peace among nations, peace within nations. But without peace officers, we can never have peace. Edgar Hoover knew this basic truth. He shaped his life around it. He was the peace officer without peer.
The United States is a better country because this good man lived his long life among us these past 77 years. Each of us stands forever in his debt. In the years ahead, let us cherish his memory. Let us be true to his legacy. Let us honor him as he would surely want us to do, by honoring all the men and women who carry on in this noble profession of helping to keep the peace in our society.
In the Bible, the book which Edgar Hoover called his ""guide to daily life,"" we find the words which best pronounce a benediction on his death. They are from the Psalms: ""Great peace have they which love Thy law."" J. Edgar Hoover loved the law of his God. He loved the law of his country. And he richly earned peace through all eternity."
"March 17, 1971","Eulogy Delivered at Burial Services for Whitney M. Young, Jr., in Lexington, Kentucky",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-delivered-burial-services-for-whitney-m-young-jr-lexington-kentucky,Richard Nixon,eulogy,"Mrs. Young, friends of Whitney Young:
It is customary on such an occasion for the one who has the honor to deliver the eulogy to say that we are gathered here to pay our last respects to the deceased. I do not say that today. I say, rather, that today a grateful Nation will pay its respect to Whitney Young by continuing the work for which he dedicated his entire life.
When we consider that life, these are some of the things we find:
In an age when we see so many people who want to be for the right thing, we also find that it is very difficult to accomplish the right thing. It is really easy to be for what is right. What is more difficult is to accomplish what is right.
And Whitney Young's genius was: He knew how to accomplish what other people were merely for. He was a very complex man, and he understood the complexities of the society in which he lived and the goals which he sought to achieve. He was not a patient man, but he understood the uses of patience.
And he was not a moderate man in terms of his goals, but he knew the uses of moderation in achieving those goals.
All of us who have heard him speak recognize him as one of the most eloquent speakers of our time, and, yet, Whitney Young will be remembered as a doer, not a talker.
What monument do we build to him? He leaves his own monument, not one, but thousands, thousands of men and women in his own race who have a chance, an equal chance, that they otherwise might never have had except for what he did; and thousands of others not of his own race who have an understanding in their hearts which they would not have had except for what he taught.
What message does he leave for us? I recall the conversation I had with him right after the election of 1968 before the inauguration when we discussed the possibilities of his becoming a member of the Cabinet. He was honored by the suggestion, and, after consideration, he told me that he felt that he could do more for those things he believed in outside of Government than inside of Government.
And in that is a message for all of us. At a time when it is so often the custom whenever we have a problem to throw up our hands and say, ""What is the Government going to do?"", this man said, ""What can I do?"" And that is the challenge he gives to each of us.
Government has its responsibilities, but he says, ""What can I do? What can I do in my life to make the American dream come true?"" Because all of us must remember, we want the American dream to come true; but the American dream 'cannot come true until the American dream can be achieved by each one who is an American.
Dr. Lon Fuller, in lecturing at Yale in 1963, spoke of two kinds of morality. He spoke of the morality of duty and of the morality of aspiration. The morality of duty is one that requires every individual to do what the law calls upon him to do. The morality of aspiration does not require, but it inspires a man or a woman to go beyond that and to do what the better angels of his nature would call upon him to do.
And it is in that spirit that I speak of Whitney Young today. I remember the last meeting we had in the Cabinet Room, 3 days before Christmas. You remember, all of you who knew him, he always had a little button ""Equal"" in his lapel. He just didn't wear that in his lapel, he wore it in his heart.
What he says to us and what his message to us is, is this: Every man and woman in this country is equal before God, and every man and woman in this country now, we trust, is equal before the law.
But to have true equality, it is not just what the law requires, but what we individually can do, because that respect which can only come from the heart of one person to another, a respect for his dignity, for his individuality, for his immortality, that is something that must come from each of us.
And so today Whitney Young's message to America---the country that he loved with all of its faults, loved it because he realized that this was a country in which we had the power to change what was wrong and change it peacefully--Whitney Young's message is this: ""What can I do? What can I do to make this a better country? What can I do through helping others, through recognizing their equality, their dignity, their individuality, to realize the American dream?""
His dream, if I may paraphrase, was one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice and opportunity for all. To fulfill his dream is the responsibility of each of us. It is the commitment that each of us makes in his heart on this day."
"September 09, 1969",Eulogy at Memorial Services for Senator Dirksen of Illinois,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-memorial-services-for-senator-dirksen-illinois,Richard Nixon,eulogy,"Mrs. Dirksen, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Congress, Members of the Cabinet, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Your Excellencies, and friends of Everett Dirksen throughout the Nation:
When Daniel Webster died more than a century ago, a man who differed strongly with him on many public issues rose in Congress to say this in eulogy: ""Our great men are the common property of the country.""
Everett Dirksen, of Illinois, was and is the ""common property"" of all the 50 States.
Senator Dirksen belonged to all of us because he always put his country first. He was an outspoken partisan, he was an individualist of the first rank, but he put his nation before himself and before his party.
He came to the Nation's Capital in 1932, and his public service spanned an era of enormous change in the life of our country. He played a vital part in that change. That is why it is so difficult to think of the Washington scene, of this Capitol, without him.
Only his fellow legislators, the Senators and Representatives who have gathered here today and who mourn his loss across the Nation, know the full extent of his contribution to the process of governing this country.
They know the time and concern he put into their bills, their causes, their problems. They know another side to Everett Dirksen--the side in the committees and behind the scenes where so much of the hard work and the hard bargaining is done, where there is so little that makes headlines and so much that makes legislation.
Through four Presidencies, through the adult life of most Americans living today, Everett Dirksen has had a hand in shaping almost every important law that affects our lives.
Everett Dirksen was a politician in the finest sense of that much abused word. If he were here, I think he might put it this way:
A politician knows that more important than the bill that is proposed is the law that is passed.
A politician knows that his friends are not always his allies, and that his adversaries are not his enemies.
A politician knows how to make the process of democracy work, and loves the intricate workings of the democratic system.
A politician knows not only how to count votes, but how to make his vote count.
A politician knows that his words are his weapons, but that his word is his bond.
A politician knows that only if he leaves room for discussion and room for concession can he gain room for maneuver.
A politician knows that the best way to be a winner is to make the other side feel it does not have to be a loser.
And a politician--in the Dirksen tradition-knows both the name of the game and the rules of the game, and he seeks his ends through the time-honored democratic means.
By being that kind of politician, this ""Man of the Minority"" earned the respect and affection of the majority. And by the special way he gave leadership to legislation, he added grace and elegance and courtliness to the word ""politician.""
That is how he became the leader of a minority, and one of the leaders of our Nation. And that is why, when the Senate worked its way, Everett Dirksen so often worked his way.
That is why, while he never became President, his impact and influence on the Nation was greater than that of most Presidents in our history.
He was at once a tough-minded man and a complete gentleman. He could take issue without taking offense. And if that is an example of the ""old politics,"" let us hope that it always has a place in the politics of the future.
He is a man to be remembered, as we remember the other giants of the Senate-the Websters and Calhouns, the Vandenbergs and the Tafts.
Some will remember his voice--that unforgettable voice that rolled as deep and majestically as the river that defines the western border of the State of Illinois he loved so well. Others will remember the unfailing---often self-deprecating--sense of humor which proved that a man of serious purpose need never take himself too seriously.
Others will remember the mastery of language, the gift of oratory that placed him in a class with Bryan and Churchill, showing, as only he would put it, that ""The oil can is mightier than the sword.""
But as we do honor to his memory, let us never forget the single quality that made him unique, the quality that made him powerful, made him beloved: the quality of character.
Everett Dirksen cultivated an appearance that made him seem old-fashioned, an incarnation of a bygone year. But that quality of character is as modern as a Saturn V.
As he could persuade, he could be persuaded. His respect for other points of view lent weight to his own point of view. He was not afraid to change his position if he were persuaded that he had been wrong. That tolerance and sympathy were elements of his character and that character gained him the affection and esteem of millions of his fellow Americans.
We shall always remember Everett Dirksen in the terms he used to describe his beloved marigolds: hardy, vivid, exuberant, colorful--and uniquely American.
To his family, his staff, and his legion of friends who knew and loved Everett Dirksen, I would like to add a personal word.
There are memorable moments we will never know again--those eloquent speeches, the incomparable anecdotes, those wonderfully happy birthday parties.
But he, least of all, would want this to be a sad occasion. With his dramatic sense of history, I can hear him now speaking of the glory of this moment.
As a man of politics, he knew both victory. and defeat.
As a student of philosophy, he knew the triumph of and the tragedy and the misery of life.
And as a student of history, he knew that some men achieve greatness, others are not recognized for their greatness until after their death. Only a privileged few live to hear the favorable verdict of history on their careers.
Two thousand years ago the poet Sophocles wrote: ""One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.""
We who were privileged to be his friends can take comfort in the fact that Everett Dirksen--in the rich evening of his life, his leadership unchallenged, his mind clear, his great voice still powerful across the land--could look back upon his life and say: The day has indeed been splendid."
"March 30, 1969",Eulogy Delivered at the Capitol During the State Funeral of General Eisenhower,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/eulogy-delivered-the-capitol-during-the-state-funeral-general-eisenhower,Richard Nixon,eulogy,"Mrs. Eisenhower, Your Excellencies, friends of Dwight David Eisenhower in America and throughout the world:
We gather today in mourning, but also in gratitude.
We mourn Dwight Eisenhower's death, but we are grateful for his life.
We gather, also, conscious of the fact that in paying tribute to Dwight Eisenhower, we celebrate greatness. When we think of his place in history, we think, inevitably, of the other giants of those days of World War II; and we think of the qualities of greatness and what his were that made his unique among all.
Once, perhaps without intending to do so, he, himself, put his finger on it. It was 1945, shortly after VE-Day, at a ceremony in London's historic Guildhall. The triumphant Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe was officially given the Freedom of the City of London.
In an eloquent address that day, Dwight Eisenhower said: ""I come from the heart of America.""
Perhaps no one sentence could better sum up what Dwight Eisenhower meant to a whole generation of Americans. He did come from the heart of America, not only from its geographical heart, but from its spiritual heart.
He exemplified what millions of parents hoped that their sons would be: strong and courageous and honest and compassionate. And with his own great qualities of heart, he personified the best in America.
It is, I think, a special tribute to Dwight Eisenhower that despite all of his honors, despite all of his great deeds and his triumphs, we find ourselves today thinking, first, not of his deeds but of his character. It was the character of the man, not what he did, but what he was that so captured the trust and faith and affection of his own people and of the people of the world.
Dwight Eisenhower touched something fundamental in America which only a man of immense force of mind and spirit could have brought so vibrantly alive. He was a product of America's soil and of its ideals, driven by a compulsion to do right and to do well; a man of deep faith who believed in God and trusted in His will; a man who truly loved his country and for whom words like ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" were not cliches, but they were living truths.
I know Mrs. Eisenhower would permit me to share with you the last words he spoke to her on the day he died. He said: ""I have always loved my wife. I have always loved my children. I have always loved my grandchildren. And I have always loved my country."" That was Dwight Eisenhower.
He was a man who gave enormously of himself. His way of relaxing from the intense pressures of office or command was to do something else intensely, whether as a fierce competitor on the golf course or executing one of those hauntingly beautiful paintings that he did with such meticulous care. But even more than this, he gave enormously of himself to people. People loved Dwight Eisenhower. But the other side of this coin was that he loved people.
He had the great leader's capacity to bring out the best in people. He had the great humanist's capacity to inspire people, to cheer them, to give them lift.
I remember, for example, just a few months ago when I asked all of the members of the Cabinet to go out and call on him. And each of them returned with wonder and admiration and said: ""You know, I went out there to cheer him up and instead I found he cheered me up.""
His great love of people was rooted in his faith. He had a deep faith in the goodness of God and in the essential goodness of man as a creature of God.
This feeling toward people had another side. In the political world, strong passions are the norm and all too often these turn toward personal vindictiveness. People often disagreed with Dwight Eisenhower, but almost nobody ever hated him. And this, I think, was because he, himself, was a man who did not know how to hate.
Oh, he could be aroused by a cause, but he could not hate a person. He could disagree strongly, even passionately, but never personally.
When people disagreed with him, he never thought of them as enemies. He simply thought: ""Well, they don't agree with me.""
I remember time after time, when critics of one sort or another were misrepresenting him or reviling him, he would sit back in his chair and with that wonderful half-smile and half-frown, he would say: ""I am puzzled by those fellows."" And he was genuinely puzzled by frenzy and by hate. Because he was incapable of it himself, he could never quite understand it in others.
The last time I saw him that was what he talked about. He was puzzled by the hatreds he had seen in our times. And he said the thing the world needs most today is understanding, an ability to see the other person's point of view and not to hate him because he disagrees. That was Dwight Eisenhower.
And yet, of course, he was more than all that. He had a side more evident to those of us who worked with him than to the rest of the world. He was a strong man. He was shrewd. He was decisive.
Time and again I have seen him make decisions that probably made the difference between war and peace for America and the world.
That was always when he was at his best. No matter how heated the arguments were, he was always then the coolest man in the room.
Dwight Eisenhower was that rarest of men, an authentic hero.
Wars bring the names of many men into the headlines and of those some few become national or even international heroes. But as the years then pass, their fame goes down.
But not so with Dwight Eisenhower. As the years passed, his stature grew: Commander of the mightiest expeditionary force ever assembled, receiver of the surrender of the German Armies in World War II, president of Columbia University, Supreme Commander of NATO, 34th President of the United States. The honors, the offices were there in abundance. Every trust that the American people had it in their power to bestow, he was given.
And, yet, he always retained a saving humility. His was the humility not of fear but of confidence. He walked with the great of the world, and he knew that the great are human. His was the humility of man before God and before the truth. His was the humility of a man too proud to be arrogant.
The pursuit of peace was uppermost in his mind when he ran for the Presidency. And it was uppermost in his conduct of that office. And it is a tribute to his skill and determination that not since the 1930's has the Nation enjoyed so long a period of peace, both at home and abroad, as the one that began in 1953 and continued through his Presidency.
As Commander of the mightiest allied force ever assembled, he was the right man at the right place at the right time. And as President, once again he was the right man at the right place at the right time.
He restored calm to a divided nation. He gave Americans a new measure of self-respect. He invested his office with dignity and respect and trust. He made Americans proud of their President, proud of their country, proud of themselves. And if we in America were proud of Dwight Eisenhower, it was partly because he made us proud of America.
He came from the heart of America. And he gave expression to the heart of America, and he touched the hearts of the world.
Many leaders are known and respected outside their own countries. Very few are loved outside their own countries. Dwight Eisenhower was one of those few. He was probably loved by more people in more parts of the world than any President America has ever had.
He captured the deepest feelings of free men everywhere. The principles he believed in, the ideals he stood for, these were bigger than his own country.
Perhaps he himself put it best again in that Guildhall speech in 1945. He said then: ""Kinship among nations is not determined in such measurements as proximity, size and age. Rather, we should turn to those inner things--call them what you will--I mean those intangibles that are the real treasures free men possess.
""To preserve his freedom of worship, his equality before law, his liberty to speak and act as he sees fit, subject only to provisions that he trespass not upon similar rights of others--a Londoner will fight. So will a citizen of Abilene.
""When we consider these things, then the Valley of the Thames draws closer to the farms of Kansas and the plains of Texas.""
Some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations: For 8 years now, Dwight Eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation. And, yet, he remained through his final days the world's most admired and respected man--truly, the first citizen of the world.
As we marvel at this, it leads us once again to ponder the mysteries of greatness. Dwight Eisenhower's greatness derived not from his office, but from his character, from a unique moral force that transcended national boundaries, even as his own deep concern for humanity transcended national boundaries.
His life reminds us that there is a moral force in this world more powerful than the might of arms or the wealth of nations. This man who led the most powerful armies that the world has ever seen, this man who led the most powerful nation in the world, this essentially good and gentle and kind man--that moral force was his greatness.
For a quarter of a century to the very end of his life Dwight Eisenhower exercised a moral authority without parallel in America and in the world. And America and the world are better because of it.
And so today we render our final salute. It is a fond salute to a man we loved and cherished. It is a grateful salute to a man whose whole extraordinary life was consecrated to service. It is a profoundly respectful salute to a man larger than life who by any standard was one of the giants of our time.
Each of us here will have a special memory of Dwight Eisenhower.
I can see him now standing erect, straight, proud, and tall 16 years ago as he took the oath of office as the 34th President of the United States of America.
We salute Dwight David Eisenhower standing there in our memories, first in war, first in peace, and, wherever freedom is cherished, first in the hearts of his fellow men."
"September 17, 1967",Remarks at the Memorial Service for Carl Sandburg,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-memorial-service-for-carl-sandburg,Lyndon B. Johnson,eulogy,"Secretary Udall, Mrs. Sandburg, our beloved Chief Justice and Mrs. Warren, Members of the United States Senate, Dean Sayre, Mr. Van Doren, Mr. MacLeish, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:
I am both honored and saddened by the opportunity to join today with Carl Sandburg's friends in celebrating that vital, exuberant, wise, and generous man.
This is the right place for thinking about Carl Sandburg. To him--and to me--Abraham Lincoln was the embodiment of our national aspirations, the nearest that any man has come to summing up the American experience in himself.
Sandburg loved to come here, to what he once called ""the fog-swept Lincoln Memorial, white as a blond woman's arm.""
I have no pretensions as a literary critic, but I think Carl Sandburg belongs in a very special category among poets, along with Walt Whitman.
Whitman wrote:
""The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem .... Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night.""
And like Whitman, Sandburg seemed to have his finger on the American pulse. He seemed able to give voice to the whole range of America's hopes and America's hates. He seemed able to communicate, above all, the restless energy that has vitalized, stimulated, and--on occasion--degraded the history of our Nation.
He could give you the savage emotions of a lynch mob. He could just as well express, with affection and insight, the courage, and the impatience, even the braggadocio, that spurred our amazing development.
He said in ""Good Morning America"":
""We are afraid; what are we afraid of? We are afraid of nothing much, nothing at all, nothing in the shape of god, man or beast, we can eat any ashes offered us, we can step out before the fact of the Fact of Death and look it in the eye and laugh, 'You are the beginning or the end of something, I'll gamble with you, I'll take a chance.'""
And only those of us who have spent almost a lifetime in the pressure chamber of politics could possibly appreciate the humor and the insight of his ""Money, Politics, Love and Glory"":
""Who put up that cage? Who hung it up with bars, doors? Why do those on the inside want to get out? Why do those outside want to get in? What is this crying inside and out all the time? What is this endless, useless beating of baffled wings at these bars, doors, this cage?""
At the end of a long day, with the phones all ringing and the world in disarray, those words have a very special impact for some of us.
Well, Carl Sandburg is gone. He is pan of the earth that he celebrated in Illinois and Kentucky and North Carolina. He is part of the American earth.
What will live on forever though is his faith--his faith in the individual human beings whom we impersonally call ""Americans.""
He knew that always in America ""the strong men keep coming on.""
So let us respect his wishes and ""ring no bell at all"" to mourn his death. But surely we must, as he asked us, ""sing one song"" in memory of this strong singer of ours.
I will miss him; we will all miss him. There will not be one like him again."
